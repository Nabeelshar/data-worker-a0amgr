<h1>Chapter 8: Getting Closer</h1>

“Put these on the windows and doors tonight, and there shouldn’t be any problems.” Looking at the time, it was almost 9:30. I handed the several household protective talismans I had brought to Liu Jianjun and instructed him.

“If you hear someone knocking on the door or window tonight, don’t be too curious. Don’t open the door or window; just keep sleeping. However, I think that after being affected by my protective talismans, ordinary evil spirits and demons shouldn’t be able to harm people again.” Having eaten and drunk, and as it was getting late, all the necessary arrangements had been made. I planned to return to my shop to rest and recuperate, waiting for Yang Cuihua’s seventh day after death.

“You’re leaving?” Perhaps he was truly frightened by that little ghost just now, as Liu Jianjun seemed very reluctant for me to leave.

“Should I stay and engage in homosexual activities? Don’t worry, put on the talismans later, and I guarantee your safety.” Walking into the living room, I took out a cigarette from the cigarette box on the coffee table, lit it, and then said to Liu Jianjun.

“Really?” Liu Jianjun seemed to lack confidence in the talismans in his hand. Compared to these talismans, he trusted me more.

“You’ll know if you try, won’t you?” I winked at him, blew out a smoke ring, and smiled.

“Don’t forget to pick me up tomorrow night.” After opening the door, I walked to the stairwell and reminded Liu Jianjun again.

“Handsome, would you like a massage?” It was almost 10 p.m. when I left Liu Jianjun’s house. At this time, it was an excellent opportunity for those hair salons and clubs to attract customers. Walking into a single-lane alley, two girls ran out of a hair salon with pink flashing lights by the roadside and enthusiastically greeted me.

Whenever I encountered such a situation, I would swallow my saliva and shake my head at those alluring girls.

“Come in and take a look, handsome. Our girls here are young, pretty, skilled, and cheap,” one girl said, making a final attempt when she saw that I had no intention of going in for some fun.

“No money. Can I pay on credit?” With the girl incessantly nagging, I stopped and rubbed my nose, saying.

Paying on credit was a killer move; as soon as I said that, all the gods and ghosts were deterred. She rolled her eyes at me, mumbled a few words, then twisted her body and returned to the 10-square-meter shop, waiting for the next man to pass by.

The next evening, Liu Jianjun, sporting dark circles under his eyes, drove to my funeral shop.

“Didn’t sleep well?” I led him into the house and offered him a cup of tea, asking.

“I didn’t dare to sleep. As soon as I closed my eyes, I felt something trying to burrow into my body.” Liu Jianjun spoke frankly, without feeling any shame.

“Is that so? Then I’ll give you a talismans for calming the mind and spirit later. Put it under your pillow at home, and I guarantee you’ll have a peaceful sleep,” I said, sitting opposite him and taking a sip of tea.

“Your business isn’t doing very well, is it?” Liu Jianjun took a sip of tea, then showed concern for my business.

“You know that too!” I said with a slight chuckle.

“That wreath has been sitting there for over a month and still hasn’t sold. Do you want me to help you promote it?” Liu Jianjun might have felt a growing sense of obligation towards me and wanted to help me with my business.

“Stop joking. Are you going to ask people if they need wreaths and funeral money? This kind of thing, even if people want to do you a favor, they can’t, can they?” I refilled my teacup and smiled at Liu Jianjun.

“That’s true. Or maybe you should switch to selling something else,” Liu Jianjun pondered for a moment, also feeling some impropriety, then advised me.

“All I can do is make wreaths and perform rituals. Sell something else? Like opening a small hair salon?” I looked around at the paper figures and wreaths filling the room, scratched my head, and asked.

“Can’t you think of something good?” Liu Jianjun glared at me and said.

“It can’t be considered a bad thing, can it? At least with a small hair salon, those girls who walk alone at night would be safer, wouldn’t they? Didn’t your police force even put up a banner that said something like ‘rape is worse than prostitution’?” I don’t think there’s anything wrong with opening a small hair salon. Everyone earns a living through hard work. Their bodies are their own; they use what they have to earn money. It’s not as heinous as the propaganda makes it out to be. At least it’s much better than those who exploit the common people. Those people are swindlers, while those who open small hair salons operate with clear prices.

“You, you’re just morally corrupt,” Liu Jianjun said, shaking his head as he looked at me.

“At least I’m still a kind person, aren’t I?” I said, shrugging.

“That’s true!” Liu Jianjun agreed on this point.

“What time are we leaving?” We had two cups of tea and chatted for a while. Liu Jianjun raised his wrist, looked at his watch, and asked me.

“What’s the rush? Just get there before midnight. It’s only a matter of minutes; it’ll be quick,” I said, standing up and stretching.

“Let’s go now!” Around 10 PM that night, I went upstairs to the attic and retrieved the money sword enshrined before the Three Pure Ones statues. Then, I said to Liu Jianjun, who was somewhat restless.

“Notify your colleagues to prepare for arrests,” I said to Liu Jianjun, sitting in the police car.

“Are you sure you can find the real killer?” Liu Jianjun asked me after slowing down the car.

“I’m sure I know who the real killer is. Whether you can catch them or not is your business. Before arresting them, have them carry this with them.” I pulled a few protective talismans from my pocket and handed them to Liu Jianjun. It’s fine for the police to make arrests, but don’t forget, that person still has a little ghost by their side.

“Xu Hairong, notify the brothers to report back.” Liu Jianjun immediately dialed his colleague’s number upon hearing this. He was now deeply convinced of the talismans’ effects.

“Captain, what are you up to? I just finished showering…” Xu Hairong’s dissatisfied voice came from the other end of the phone. With continuous cases and continuous overtime, she hadn’t spent quality time with her husband for almost a week. Today, she finally found some free time to cultivate some romance and interest, only for Liu Jianjun’s call to ruin it.

“Uh, report back to prepare for the arrest. I’ll give you a few days off after the case is closed.” Liu Jianjun was also a bit embarrassed about ruining their intimate moment. After some thought, he said to Xu Hairong on the phone.

All preparations were complete, and Liu Jianjun also drove me to the criminal police team. It was almost 10:30. I got out of the car, looked up at the slightly hazy moon, and followed Liu Jianjun to the morgue located downstairs.

“Captain Liu, not resting at such a late hour?” The old man guarding the morgue heard the knock, put on his coat, got up, opened the door, and asked.

“The higher-ups are pressing hard on the case, so we have no choice,” Liu Jianjun said, handing a cigarette to the old man.

“Alright, come in. The higher-ups, too, what’s the use of just forcing you when it comes to solving cases or not?” The old man sighed lightly, then turned his body to let us in.
