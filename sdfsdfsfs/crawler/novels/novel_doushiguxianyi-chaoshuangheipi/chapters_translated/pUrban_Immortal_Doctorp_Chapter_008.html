<h1>Eighth Chapter: Hundred Herbs Hall</h1>

Xiang Yuntian knelt on one knee, holding the bouquet of blue enchantress flowers in his hand, and said with affectionate eyes, "Chuchu, from the moment I saw you, I knew I was completely smitten for life.

My heart has been completely filled by you. Besides you, I will never look at any other woman again. Will you be my girlfriend?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the surrounding crowd once again shouted, "Be together...be together...be together..."

Seeing how persistent this guy was, Qin Chuchu looked at Ye Bufan for help.

Ye Bufan chuckled and said jokingly, "You're so good at acting, it's a waste that you're not an actor."

Xiang Yuntian cried out with an indignant expression, "What are you talking about? My sincerity toward Chuchu can be witnessed by heaven. If there's a single false word, may I be struck by lightning immediately!"

"Is that so? Then let everyone see how sincere your sincerity is."

"I..."

Xiang Yuntian looked embarrassed, because he dated women every day, and Durex was standard equipment, always carried with him.

Ye Bufan reached out and pulled out two small white pills from his other pocket.

Qin Chuchu pulled Ye Bufan aside and said with shining eyes, "How did you do that?"

Bai Cao Tang was completely decorated in an antique style, looking ancient and powerful.

After speaking, she turned and walked into the office building of Qin's Group. After all this commotion, she was about to be late for work.

"Girl, you have a good eye, the young man you chose is not bad..."

At this moment, he could no longer pretend. He waved his fist and punched Ye Bufan's face. Unfortunately, his body, hollowed out by wine and women, was no match for Ye Bufan. He was kicked in the abdomen and flew backward, landing on the nine hundred and ninety-nine roses.

Ye Bufan casually threw away the small panties, then reached out and pulled a pink object from Xiang Yuntian’s pants pocket.

"Young Master Xiang, if I'm not mistaken, this is the legendary regret pill, right? Your equipment is really complete. Could it be that this is also a prank arranged by your friend?"

Since it had just opened, there were not many customers in the pharmacy, and none had reached the stage of getting medicine. There was only one clerk filling prescriptions at the counter, playing with his phone.

Seeing that everything he had carefully planned was ruined, Xiang Yuntian immediately became enraged, "You bastard, I'll kill you!"

"The things inside must have been put there by him. It has nothing to do with me."

Ye Bufan came to the counter and said, "I'm here to get some medicine."

"Oh my goodness, I was almost fooled by this scumbag just now. He's got another woman's stuff in his pocket and he's confessing to someone else. What a weirdo..."

Xiang Yuntian uttered a harsh remark and was about to flee in a panic, but before he had even run a few steps, the manhole cover beneath his feet suddenly flipped over, and with a splash, he fell in.

Of course, Ye Bufan wouldn't reveal anything about his divine sense. He said, "I'm a Chinese medicine doctor. I've long seen that this kid has severe kidney deficiency, so I could guess it with a little thought."

Seeing Ye Bufan enter, he just glanced at him without speaking, then continued playing on his own.

"Didn't he say he'd be struck by lightning? Heaven should strike this kind of person dead..."

This pair was left from last night; he hadn't had time to deal with it yet.

Watching Young Master Xiang, who was just acting so arrogantly, now looking so pathetic, people burst into unrestrained laughter.

But it was a thong, and it was lace, smaller than a typical handkerchief. It couldn't be seen when stuffed into a pocket. How did this kid find it?

Upon seeing this scene, the surrounding people immediately stirred.

Ye Bufan said, reaching out with lightning speed to pull a white object from inside Xiang Yuntian's suit jacket. It was clearly a woman's intimate small underwear, and a very sexy one at that, almost transparent.

"What about this one? Does this have anything to do with you?"

His speed was so fast that Xiang Yuntian couldn't react at all.

"Young man, well done, I admire no one but you..."

It's estimated that after today's events, Xiang Yuntian will no longer have the face to pursue her.

Holding this object, he said with a smirk, "Young Master Xiang, explain, is this your true heart?

However, he was also extremely curious. Compared to the small panties just now, the Durex was even smaller. How did this kid know? Did he have x-ray vision?

"Chuchu, please don't misunderstand, I don't know where this thing came from. Maybe my friend was playing a prank on me. I really don't know anything."

Qin Chuchu stopped asking, saying, "Thank you for your help. I'll treat you to dinner after work."

Although the fall wasn't too severe this time, those roses had thorns. By the time he struggled to get up, his body was covered in rose thorns.

Ye Bufan also left here and, after a while, arrived at the largest traditional Chinese medicine clinic in Jiangnan City – Bai Cao Tang.

This time, he was utterly distraught. When he climbed out of the manhole again, his body was covered in garbage, emitting a foul odor.

His performance just now was so unexpected, it could even be called stunning. He crushed Young Master Xiang of the Xiang family.

"Young Master Xiang, this thing should be called Durex, right? Where did it come from? Did you lend your pants to a friend too?"

Ye Bufan smiled, "Haven't you seen it all?"

"Shameless, absolutely shameless. Carrying this thing in his pocket, yet still speaking so grandiosely. How can his skin be so thick..."

His subordinates, whom he had placed in the crowd, hurried over and helped him, looking disheveled, leave the place.

People usually disliked the behavior of these rich young masters but were powerless to do anything about it. Just now, this young man really helped them vent their anger.

At the main entrance hung a couplet: "No one sees the refining of medicine; Heaven knows the heart."

Xiang Yuntian let out a heartbreaking scream.

"Ah..."

Qin Chuchu said with a blush, "I mean, how did you know Xiang Yuntian had that kind of thing in his pocket?"

Xiang Yuntian licked his dry lips and, in a moment of quick wit, said, "Chuchu, don't misunderstand. Yesterday, a friend went on a date and borrowed this suit from me to put on a front.

At this point, Xiang Yuntian could only deny everything, otherwise all his efforts would be in vain.

The onlookers praised Ye Bufan endlessly.

Ye Bufan stepped in and looked around. On the left was the pharmacy, and on the right was a traditional Chinese medicine clinic.

"I..."

"Since you're so devoted to Chuchu and haven't looked at any other woman for half a year, where did this thing come from? You wouldn't use it yourself, would you?"

Qin Chuchu looked at everything before her and said with a look of disgust, "Xiang Yuntian, just leave. I don't want to see you again!"

Xiang Yuntian was immediately stunned. It wasn't that he hadn't seen women for half a year; it was that he couldn't live without women every day. He also had a special hobby: every time he slept with a woman, he would keep a pair of her panties as a souvenir.

"Is that so? Then what's this?"

"Kid, you dare to steal my woman, just you wait."

The clerk didn't even lift his head and said, "Wait a moment, can't you see I'm busy?"

Ye Bufan was speechless for a while. Was playing King of Glory considered busy? This was probably the legendary store bullying customers!

He felt like turning around and leaving, but the types of medicinal herbs he needed to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill were numerous, and some were quite uncommon, so other small pharmacies didn't have them all.
