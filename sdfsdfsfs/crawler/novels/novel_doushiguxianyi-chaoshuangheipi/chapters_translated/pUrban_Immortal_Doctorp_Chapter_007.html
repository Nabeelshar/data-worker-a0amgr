<h1>Chapter 7: Pretending to be a Boyfriend</h1>

Ye Bufan saw that it was Qin Chuchu he had bumped into, and couldn't help but laugh, "What, you didn't enjoy hitting me with your car yesterday, so now you're using a person to bump into me?"

As he said this, he thought to himself, being bumped by a person is much more comfortable than being hit by a car, soft and elastic.

Ye Bufan couldn't help but glance at Qin Chuchu's shapely figure. This woman looked very slender, but she had all the right curves.

Especially that part, the size was quite astonishing, the buttons on her chest were almost bursting. He wondered if that soft feeling just now came from there.

Qin Chuchu also didn't expect to meet Ye Bufan here. After a slight surprise, she said, "Don't talk so much, it's an emergency, help me out."

Ye Bufan said with some surprise, "Help with what? Do you need to borrow money?"

"Not money, I need to borrow you for a bit, pretend to be my boyfriend."

Ye Bufan said, "No problem, leave it to me."

As they were talking, Xiang Yuntian also noticed them and quickly walked over with that bouquet of blue enchantment roses.

Qin Chuchu nodded, "His name is Xiang Yuntian, he's been chasing me for a while now, it's so annoying."

Ye Bufan's expression remained unchanged and he said calmly, "You mean only rich people are qualified to pursue Chuchu? Or do you think Chuchu is a gold-digger who only cares about money?"

Qin Chuchu didn't even look at the bouquet of blue enchantment roses and said impolitely, "Xiang Yuntian, how many times have I told you, it's impossible between us, and I already have a boyfriend."

"How touching, if only someone treated me like that, I would marry him without hesitation..."

But then her heart stirred, and she said, "You won't help? I just came back from the traffic police department and I've seen the surveillance footage. The accident yesterday wasn't me hitting you, but you staging it..."

Hearing the whispers around, Qin Chuchu felt a bit disheartened. She was just desperate to find a shield and forgot the gap between the two of them. Ye Bufan was still too far behind Xiang Yuntian.

"Chuchu, even if you want to find someone to pretend to be your boyfriend, you should find someone with a bit of class. Finding someone like this, do you think I'll believe it?"

Xiang Yuntian said, "Chuchu, don't lie to me, I know your situation better than anyone, you don't have a boyfriend."

"Rich and devoted, it's really hard to find such a good man nowadays..."

In other words, Qin Chuchu is the eldest daughter of the Qin family, how could she be interested in his small money?

"No help, I have a girlfriend."

I heard your car was badly damaged, so I immediately bought you a new one. Money is secondary, what's important is my sincere feelings for you."

Qin Chuchu's face showed a hint of triumph, and she said, "Later, you help me scare away this fly, and I won't pursue the staged accident matter."

Xiang Yuntian was first startled, then carefully scrutinized Ye Bufan, and finally showed a sneer of contempt.

Ye Bufan smiled, "Then you agree, right? Although not as handsome as me, he's still decent enough."

You, a poor boy, are not qualified to pursue Chuchu, let alone compare to me."

The onlookers saw the leading lady appear and retreated to both sides, clearing a path.

Seeing that Qin Chuchu didn't speak, Xiang Yuntian became even more nervous and said again, "Chuchu, don't listen to his nonsense, I'm completely sincere to you.

"Is that even a question? If you want people to look up to you, you have to have the strength to be looked up to."

To avoid causing dissatisfaction with Qin Chuchu, he quickly explained, "Chuchu, please don't misunderstand, I really didn't mean that."

Xiang Yuntian immediately became nervous. He pursued Qin Chuchu, on the one hand, for her beauty, and on the other hand, to climb up the big tree of the Qin family.

Ye Bufan said, "I haven't graduated yet."

Qin Chuchu glared, "I'm talking seriously to you, are you helping or not?"

"But I think this young man is quite handsome..."

Xiang Yuntian looked at him mockingly and said, "Tell me, do you have eight-figure savings in your bank?"

"I...I...I certainly didn't mean that..."

"Pretend to be a boyfriend?" Ye Bufan immediately understood, "Is that person chasing you?"

Ye Bufan immediately agreed. What happened yesterday was indeed his fault. He caused so much damage to someone else's car, and he always felt a little guilty.

"My mood was quite good originally, but seeing you just made it bad."

Xiang Yuntian became even more smug. How could a poor boy who hadn't even left school compare to him, the young master of the Xiang family?

"I knew you wouldn't believe it, so I brought people today." Qin Chuchu wrapped her arm around Ye Bufan's, and said intimately, "This is my boyfriend, Ye Bufan."

Qin Chuchu's chest heaved violently with anger. The men who usually chased her couldn't be driven away, but this guy acted as if being her boyfriend was a huge disadvantage.

"Young Master Xiang is so generous, 3 million at once, if it were me, I would definitely agree..."

"Then do you have a million-dollar annual salary?"

Seeing that he was being looked down upon, Ye Bufan said, "What, looking down on me?"

"Help, I don't help others, but I will definitely help you. It's just pretending to be a boyfriend, what's the big deal."

I was so scared when I heard about your car accident yesterday, thankfully you're fine.

Qin Chuchu, however, looked at Ye Bufan with interest. His performance far exceeded her expectations. In just a few words, he trampled Xiang Yuntian's proud advantages underfoot.

Xiang Yuntian was very satisfied with the effect he created, pointing to the roses in his hand and saying, "These are blue enchantment roses specially airfreighted from Europe. Each costs 500 yuan, which is much more expensive than the cheap clothes you're wearing.

"It's not about being a gigolo, what good is just being handsome? A man still needs to have strength..."

"You..."

"No!" Ye Bufan shook his head.

He said arrogantly, "Let me tell you, our Xiang family is a large enterprise with assets exceeding 100 million, and I am the sole heir, currently serving as the group's vice president. What do you have to compare with me?"

"Did you see that? That's the new car I bought for Chuchu, worth over 3 million yuan. It's not that I look down on you, but you probably won't earn that much money in your entire life."

"Chuchu, you're here!" Xiang Yuntian came before Qin Chuchu, holding the roses in his hands, and said gallantly, "These are flowers for you, wishing you a good mood every day."

"Yes, there's really no comparison. How can a poor boy compare to Young Master Xiang?"

At this moment, everyone around looked at Ye Bufan with complex expressions: some mocked, some sympathized, and some felt pity. No one believed that a poor boy could compete with a rich young master.

"The gap is too big, if it were me, I would also choose Young Master Xiang..."

Hearing the whispers around, Xiang Yuntian secretly breathed a sigh of relief and discreetly gestured to his mole in the crowd.

Someone in the crowd immediately shouted, "Say yes to him! Get together... get together..."

In this atmosphere, some of the onlookers also began to shout.
