<h1>Chapter 6 No Peace</h1>

“What the hell, is eating human sashimi trending now?” I cursed, closed the shop, and hailed a taxi to Jiangcheng Garden. If I wasn't mistaken, the person who died today must have had an extremely close relationship with Yang Cuihua. Or perhaps, he was the fundamental reason why the killer instigated the little devil to kill.

“Oh my god, this taste is quite heavy.” Upon entering the deceased’s residence and seeing the dead man, I rubbed my nose and said. Unlike Yang Cuihua, this man had eaten his own penis, and I even saw a trace of egg yolk still lingering at the corner of his mouth.

The crime scene was in the building next to Yang Cuihua’s house. Two deaths within a week made the atmosphere of the entire community tense. People gathered, scrambling to inquire about the specific details of the cases. However, these two cases were too bizarre, and the Public Security Bureau had issued a gag order to the officers, so no one could get any information from the police.

“A very familiar smell!” I walked around the room, sniffed, and whispered. Now I was certain that this man was killed by a little devil. And the little devil who killed him was the same one who killed Yang Cuihua.

“What smell is familiar?” Liu Jianjun, as seasoned a detective as he was, detected even my soft voice.

“The smell of blood, and a little something else,” I said, glancing at him. “Finish the on-site investigation and then pack up. Take me to the morgue the day after tomorrow.” I pushed open the window, closed my eyes, and took a deep breath. After noticing that the trace of ghostly aura left by the little devil had been dispersed by the sunlight, I turned and said to Liu Jianjun.

“Who reported the case?” I stopped suddenly at the door and asked.

“The hourly worker. They both used the same hourly worker. Because they interacted a lot, the deceased trusted the hourly worker and gave her a spare key. Encountering two dead people consecutively, and both being her employers, this hourly worker is really unlucky.” Liu Jianjun raised a finger and pointed at the middle-aged woman being questioned at the door.

“Oh, the killer isn't her.” As I walked past the hourly worker, I sniffed her scent and then said to Liu Jianjun.

“Have you investigated the relationship between the person who died today and Yang Cuihua?” At the elevator, I asked Liu Jianjun again.

“Haven’t had time yet, you know, these days…” Liu Jianjun sighed softly. The previous case had no leads, and then another person died. This put a lot of pressure on Liu Jianjun, as the captain of the criminal police team.

“Let nature take its course. Some things, just because you don’t want them to happen, doesn’t mean they won’t.” To this dedicated police officer, I could only offer this comfort.

“Oh, right, watch out for your own safety!” Inside the elevator, I reminded Liu Jianjun. The killer had already taken two lives, and if Liu Jianjun's investigation got too close, there was no guarantee he wouldn't strike again.

“It’s fine, I have this!” Liu Jianjun pulled out the talisman I gave him from his jacket pocket and smiled.

“Investigate, see what connection there is between the deceased and Yang Cuihua.” It wasn't until I had left that Liu Jianjun lit a cigarette and said to his colleagues behind him.

“The deceased, Wang Yong, was the current editor-in-chief of Urban Lady Fashion Magazine. According to informed sources, he had an affair with Gong Ziyuan, which is Yang Cuihua. Yang Cuihua used Wang Yong’s power to appear on the cover of the fashion magazine multiple times. It was precisely because of this that she was able to gain considerable fame within a certain scope in a short period. In exchange, Yang Cuihua willingly became Wang Yong’s lover.” It has to be said that once the authorities get serious, their efficiency is extremely high. In just one day, the relationship between Yang Cuihua and Wang Yong was thoroughly uncovered.

“I suggest that the two cases can be investigated concurrently. These two cases are absolutely not suicides as they appear on the surface.” With progress in the cases, Liu Jianjun excitedly told his colleagues in the conference room.

“Also, colleagues, please bear with me and continue the investigation. Find out who had disputes with the deceased Wang Yong and Yang Cuihua. Perhaps, the real killer is among them.” With the case progressing to this point, Liu Jianjun finally found a lead for the investigation. He decided to follow this lead, hoping it might actually lead to the real killer.

“Team Leader Liu, time to get off work!” After working tirelessly for several days, the case finally made a little progress today. This gave the police officers of the criminal police team a moment to catch their breath. After working overtime for several days in a row, they could finally go home and spend time with their families today.

“Time to go home, everyone has worked hard recently. When the case is solved, I’ll treat you all to dinner.” Liu Jianjun hadn’t been home to see his old mother for several days; he hadn’t been back since she was discharged from the hospital. He thought about whether he should buy some good food on the way back to add a few dishes for his widowed mother.

“Alright, let's all go. If we wait any longer, what if the phone rings again?” A police officer looked at the red phone on the desk and said.

“Shut your jinxing mouth, everyone hurry up and leave, I haven’t spent time with my husband in days.” Xu Hairong rolled her eyes at that colleague, then clacked out the door first in her high heels.

“The weather isn’t cold, yet I feel a chill down my spine?” After his colleagues left, Liu Jianjun gave the office and conference room a final check, ensuring nothing was left behind before locking the door and leaving. As he walked out of the criminal police team’s main gate, he shivered for no reason, then looked at the sky and muttered to himself.

He detoured to the market to buy some braised dishes, then Liu Jianjun drove home. 6 PM was rush hour. The traffic was heavy; a drive that usually took only half an hour took a full 1.5 hours today. By the time he got home, it was 7:30 PM.

“It’s getting dark quickly.” Liu Jianjun stamped his foot, making the sensor light in the stairwell come on, then pulled out his keys and walked towards his home.

Liu Jianjun’s home was on the 5th floor, and the somewhat old stairwell was plastered with small advertisements for locksmiths, moving services, and drain cleaning. He carried the braised dishes and walked up the stairs. At his usual speed, climbing to the fifth floor would only take a few tens of seconds. But today, he felt as if he had been walking for a very long time.

“What the hell, I’ve worked up a sweat, and I’m only on the 3rd floor?” Liu Jianjun stomped his foot, making the dim sensor light in the stairwell brighten, and looked at the house number in confusion.

He raised his hand and looked at his watch, the time was 7:31. But the sticky sweat on his body made him unable to believe that he had only walked for 1 minute. Even an eighty-year-old man wouldn't break out in so much sweat climbing stairs for a minute, let alone a police officer who exercised several times a week to maintain his stamina.

“What’s going on? I’m sweating buckets from climbing three floors?” Liu Jianjun casually hung the braised dishes he was holding on someone’s doorknob, pulled out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and muttered to himself.
