<h1>Chapter 6: Why Should I Pity You?</h1>

"No, please don't! My family depends on me, if I'm sent to the police station, it'll all be over."

Xie Haitao completely panicked, falling to his knees with a thud, pleading, "Director Zhou, President Ma, Little Brother Ye, please have pity on me."

Zhou Yongliang and Ma Haidong both looked at Ye Bufan, evidently waiting for him to decide.

Faced with Xie Haitao, who was crying profusely, Ye Bufan's eyes showed no pity.

Thinking about how he had risked his life to stage an accident to get money for his mother's medical expenses, his anger flared.

"You ask me to pity you, but did you ever pity those helpless patients and their families?

Do you know how they scraped that money together? It was blood, sweat, and tears from selling their houses and land, money meant to save their loved ones!

In the end, you just casually wrote a prescription and stole it from them. This is ten times worse than a robber! Why should I pity you?"

Zhou Yongliang said nothing more. In all his years in the health sector, he had indeed never heard of a renowned doctor named Ye Xiaoyao.

Ma Haidong said, "Little Brother Ye, are you interested in working as a doctor at our hospital? As long as you're willing to come, I'll immediately make you chief physician, taking Xie Haitao's place."

Xie Haitao was left speechless, slumped on the ground like a pile of mud.

But now, with the scarcity of spiritual energy on Earth, it would be difficult to improve further. Luckily, he had obtained the ancient medical sect's inheritance, allowing him to refine pills to aid his cultivation.

In their eyes, with such generous treatment, the young man in front of them would surely agree, but to their surprise, Ye Bufan shook his head and said, "President Ma, I appreciate your kindness.

Ye Bufan quickly turned his head. It was a woman dressed in an OL professional suit, her attention also seemed to be drawn to the young people in the square, and the two of them collided.

Ye Bufan said, "I haven't graduated yet, I'm a junior at Jiangnan Medical University, and I learned traditional Chinese medicine from my master."

Early the next morning, the fiery red sun slowly rose from the east, and Ye Bufan slowly opened his eyes, a glint of sharpness flashing within them.

Ye Bufan shook his head again: "President Ma, I really am not suitable to work here."

But your hospital is a Western medicine hospital, and I study traditional Chinese medicine, so it's really not suitable for me to come here."

"I'm sorry!"

Qin's Group is a well-known enterprise in Jiangnan City, with strong capabilities. In front of its office building, there is a small plaza spanning several hundred square meters.

To express our apology, all your mother's medical expenses will be waived, and the hospital will also provide 30,000 yuan as a thank you for your help this time."

Just then, a fragrant and soft object bumped into him.

"Oh!"

He truly valued Ye Bufan's medical skills. With such a stabilizing force, any difficult and complicated diseases the hospital encountered in the future, like today's, could be immediately resolved.

Seeing Ye Bufan's attitude, Zhou Yongliang said coldly, "Go turn yourself in to the public security bureau; perhaps they'll give you a lighter sentence."

Moreover, his divine sense possessed X-ray vision, allowing him to see not only through walls, but also into the human body, clearly discerning his meridians, bones, and blood flow at that very moment.

Jiangnan Hospital is one of the top hospitals in Jiangnan City. It is highly unlikely for ordinary medical university graduates to work there. He immediately offered him a chief physician position, showing how much he valued Ye Bufan's medical skills.

A young man in his twenties, dressed in a suit, stood impeccably groomed in front of a car, holding a bouquet of blue enchantress roses, seemingly waiting to confess his love to someone.

Ma Haidong's eyes showed deep disappointment: "Alright, little brother, if you ever change your mind, I'll be waiting for you here."

As Ye Bufan passed by, many people had gathered in the square, watching something.

Not far from Jiangnan Medical University is a 20-story office building, luxuriously yet grandly decorated. This is the headquarters of Qin's Group.

Ye Bufan sighed. Zhu Linlin had disappeared since the holiday, he couldn't see her or reach her by phone, and he didn't know what was going on.

Ma Haidong waved his hand, called two security guards to drag him out, and then said with an apologetic look: "Little Brother Ye, I'm really sorry, I didn't expect such a worm to be in our hospital."

After he began cultivating, he felt a warm wisp of true qi rise from his dantian, circulating through his body along the meridian pathways of the Heart Sutra.

He then called the hospital's office director, waived all of Ouyang Lan's medical expenses, and also provided 30,000 yuan as a thank you.

Ye Bufan got out of bed, simply washed up, ate some breakfast, and feeling refreshed, left the school gate, ready to find a pharmacy to purchase the medicinal ingredients for refining the Foundation Establishment Pill.

"I......"

Ye Bufan said, "My master's name is Ye Xiaoyao; he is a reclusive master, and not many people know his name."

Ma Haidong said, "Little Brother Ye's medical skills are extraordinary. I feel that making him a chief physician is an understatement, but that's the extent of my authority."

Although it was summer vacation now, his mother's small baozi shop was only a little over ten square meters, making it inconvenient to return there, so he had been staying at the school these past few days.

Ma Haidong said, "That doesn't matter. As long as Little Brother Ye is willing to come, I can set up a separate Traditional Chinese Medicine clinic for you."

Zhou Yongliang said, "Little Brother Ye, where do you work? How do you possess such superb medical skills?"

Fortunately, neither of them were moving fast, and the woman regained her balance after taking two steps back.

The electronic prompt sounded from the phone: "Sorry, the number you dialed is switched off."

What he wanted to do was to promote traditional Chinese medicine. The hospital had too many rules and regulations, which were not suitable for personal development. In comparison, he preferred to open his own traditional Chinese medicine clinic.

Zhou Yongliang asked, "May I ask who your master is, the master of traditional Chinese medicine?"

The young man was indeed somewhat handsome, but Ye Bufan could tell at a glance that his face was pale, his qi was weak, a typical case of excessive indulgence, his body completely hollowed out by wine and women.

He glanced over, only to see a red Porsche 911 parked in the center of the square. In front of the Porsche was a heart-to-heart pattern made of nine hundred and ninety-nine roses.

What surprised him most was that after reaching the ninth level, he gained divine sense, allowing him to perceive objects within a two-meter radius even with his eyes closed.

As time went on, this wisp of true qi grew stronger, and his body became more and more comfortable.

Ye Bufan nodded. The hospital's handling attitude was very sincere, so he didn't say anything more.

Ye Bufan took the money and left Jiangnan Hospital. It was already past nine o'clock in the evening. He first called Ouyang Lan to report that he was safe, and then dialed his girlfriend Zhu Linlin's phone number.

Back in the dorm, he was the only one there; everyone else had already gone home.

At this moment, his heart was filled with excitement. After a night of cultivation, the Chaotic Heart Sutra had reached the ninth layer of the Qi Refining stage, just one step away from Foundation Establishment.

Zhou Yongliang laughed, "President Ma, you are truly eager for talent!"

After a simple wash-up, he sat cross-legged on the bed and began to cultivate the Chaotic Heart Sutra, passed down from the ancient medical sect.

He knew that his cultivation had progressed so quickly entirely due to the spiritual energy transformed from the ancient jade pendant.

According to the records of the ancient medical sect, the Chaotic Heart Sutra was passed down by Shennong, the ancestor of medicine. It is an extremely advanced cultivation technique, and also suitable for healing and saving lives.

"I'm sorry!"

Both knew they hadn't been paying attention to where they were going, and apologized to each other in unison.

Then they both exclaimed, "How is it you?"
