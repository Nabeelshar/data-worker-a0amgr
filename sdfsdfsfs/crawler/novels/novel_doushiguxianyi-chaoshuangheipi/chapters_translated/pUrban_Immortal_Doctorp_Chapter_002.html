<h1>Chapter 2: Astronomical Medical Expenses</h1>

Xie Haitao was stunned by Ye Bufan's actions. After recognizing him, he shouted, "Boy, everyone's dead. What are you still messing around for?

Are you trying to act filial? If you had that much filial piety, you would have brought 50,000 yuan earlier for the surgery, and your mother wouldn't have died. No money but still like to pretend, I despise people like you the most..."

He chattered on and on, but Ye Bufan ignored him completely, focusing on giving Ouyang Lan acupuncture.

"Boy, I'm talking to you, did you hear me?"

Seeing that the young man in front of him was ignoring him, Xie Haitao immediately got angry and shouted again, "Are you a doctor? Sticking a broken needle here haphazardly, do you want your mother to die even without peace?

I'm telling you, this is an ICU ward, and it's charged by the hour. The medical expenses you owed before haven't been paid yet, what kind of mischief are you doing here?

Stop it immediately!"

Ye Bufan finally inserted the last needle and let out a long sigh of relief.

Ye Bufan angrily said, "My mother was saved by me, why should I pay so much money?"

"Stop! You can't leave yet."

Just now, a quack doctor misdiagnosed you, pronouncing you dead. This is a disregard for human life!

Now you're fabricating things, prescribing drugs indiscriminately. Most of these drugs are not for you, but you're coming to us to collect money. How can a person like him be a doctor!"

Ouyang Lan held the bill, she didn't understand medicine at all, the only thing she could understand were the shocking exorbitant numbers on it.

"This is our ICU ward, charged by the hour, plus the emergency medicines, that's how much it is."

"I..."

Xie Haitao opened his arms and stood in front of them.

Ouyang Lan said, "Oh, of course, how much does it cost, Doctor?"

Ye Bufan not only cured his mother's cerebral hemorrhage but also sorted out other hidden ailments in her body.

At this moment, Xie Haitao recovered and shouted, "Nonsense! These are the emergency medicines for your mother, you must pay today, otherwise, I'll send all of you to the police station!"

His mother suffered from an acute cerebral hemorrhage. This disease was nothing to the ancient medical sect. It was fortunate that they returned in time; if they had delayed any longer, it would have been too late.

"Alright then, let's go. I've always said minor ailments don't need a trip to the hospital, a little rest will do."

Ouyang Lan said, "Son, what's wrong? Why are you so angry?"

Ouyang Lan and Zhang Xiaoman were both startled, not understanding why Ye Bufan was so angry, and quickly came over to dissuade him.

"Cough... cough... cough..." Xie Haitao finally breathed fresh air, gasping heavily.

Ouyang Lan was startled. If Ye Bufan hadn't helped her improve her body just now, she probably would have collapsed on the hospital bed again.

Xie Haitao shouted, "Boy, have you had enough? This period of time just now will also be charged."

Ye Bufan said coldly, "You quack, what are you talking about? My mother is still alive!"

Firstly, he could get a commission from the hospital, and secondly, he could make another profit by selling these medicines. He had often done this in the past, but he didn't expect Ye Bufan to see through it today.

Ouyang Lan raised Ye Bufan and his sister alone, and life was hard. She feared nothing more than spending money at the hospital.

Xie Haitao said, "You can leave, but you have to settle the medical bill first."

Xie Haitao was choked by the neck, immediately feeling difficulty breathing, but no matter how hard he struggled, Ye Bufan's large hand remained as unmoving as an iron clamp.

Then he said to Zhang Xiaoman, "Immediately call the funeral home and have them take away the body."

Also, the total volume of these injections is over 25 kilograms. Are you telling me all of this was used on my mother?

Ye Bufan excitedly grabbed Ouyang Lan's hand. If he hadn't coincidentally received the inheritance of the ancient medical sect, the mother and son would truly have been separated by life and death.

"Mom, you're finally awake."

Xie Haitao and Zhang Xiaoman were both dumbfounded. Just now, this person indeed showed no signs of life, how could he suddenly come back to life? If this wasn't an ICU ward, they would truly think it was a reanimated corpse.

"Son, let go quickly, hitting people is illegal."

He was a third-year student at Jiangnan Medical University. Although he hadn't graduated, he had some knowledge of common drugs.

"It's alright, Mom, you're better now, let's go home right away."

One... two, at first a bit slow, but soon returned to normal.

Zhang Xiaoman went forward to pull Ye Bufan's arm, but found that the seemingly not-so-strong arm was like a mountain, unmovable in the slightest.

Originally, he thought this mother and son understood nothing, so he had prescribed a large number of drugs indiscriminately.

Xie Haitao said, "Of course, hurry up and pay!"

Seeing Ouyang Lan step forward to dissuade him, Ye Bufan finally let go.

Ye Bufan glanced at it, and his expression immediately darkened, "Are you sure these are all the medicines used for my mother?"

Xie Haitao said, throwing a stack of medication details to Ouyang Lan, "Look, we spent a lot of manpower and medication to save you, otherwise you would have died long ago, how could you be standing here talking."

Ye Bufan frowned: "What do you want to do?"

As he was speaking, the monitor equipment at the head of the bed suddenly beeped, and then resumed work. Ouyang Lan actually had a heartbeat.

Ye Bufan angrily said, "This heartless doctor, he asked me to pay 50,000 yuan for surgery, and when I couldn't, he just watched her die.

Xie Haitao said, "Thirty-nine thousand eight." "What, so much money?"

Ye Bufan was furious, he grabbed his neck and slammed him against the wall.

Xie Haitao was completely dumbfounded, speechless for a moment.

Twenty-five kilograms of IV fluids in less than twenty-four hours, even an elephant couldn't handle that, could it?"

Xie Haitao said with a disdainful look, "Alive? Are you mentally ill? If your mother can come back to life, I'll give you my position as chief doctor..."

Xie Haitao’s eyes widened instantly, utterly disbelieving everything in front of him. He was most clear about Ouyang Lan's condition; even if she hadn't died, she couldn't possibly recover this quickly.

"Someone like you, being incompetent is one thing, but to be so black-hearted, how do you deserve the title of doctor?"

Ouyang Lan was definitely healthier than anyone right now, so there was no need to stay here.

Ye Bufan held the medical bill and said, "Are you bullying us for not understanding? My mother had severe cerebral hemorrhage, so what's up with Thrombosis-clearing injection on this prescription? And what's up with Ginseng & Deer Antler injection?

"This... what's going on here?"

When he finished, Ouyang Lan sat up from the bed with a jolt, looked around, and said, "Son, where am I?"

With that, she got out of bed and, along with Ye Bufan, was about to leave.

Seeing that the time was right, Ye Bufan raised his hand and retrieved all the silver needles from his mother's body, and then removed the monitoring equipment one by one.

Ouyang Lan said, "Son, what's wrong? Mom remembers suddenly fainting, am I sick? Will it cost a lot of money?"

Just as he was at a loss, the door of the emergency room suddenly opened, and a middle-aged man ran in carrying a boy around ten years old.

The middle-aged man shouted, "Doctor, quickly see what's wrong with my son?"

The nurse standing by came forward and said to Xie Haitao, "Director Xie, this is a patient arranged by Director Zhou of the Health Bureau, who instructed us to give him our full attention."
