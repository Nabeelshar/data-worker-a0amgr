<h1>Chapter 1: The Encounter with a Female Driver While Faking an Accident</h1>

Jiangnan City, morning.

Ye Bufan stood by the road, looking at the surging traffic with a complex expression.

"Go pay the surgery fee quickly, or I guarantee your mother won't live past today."

"You still have the nerve to ask for money? You haven't paid back the money you borrowed from us last time..."

"No money! No money! What does your mother's death have to do with me?"

Ye Bufan's mother was hospitalized, in urgent need of 50,000 yuan for surgery. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't raise a single cent, which made him extremely anxious.

"It seems the only way is to stage an accident to raise the surgery fee for my mother. Although it goes against my conscience, there's nothing else I can do. I'll pay them back as soon as I have the money."

After deciding to stage an accident, he looked at the road again. 50,000 yuan was not a small sum; he had to find a good car.

At that moment, a red Maserati drove over, its speed not appearing to be too fast.

"This is it!"

Ye Bufan quickly took two steps forward and lunged in front of the Maserati.

He had seen several cases of staged accidents online and was familiar with the procedure. He thought that upon seeing him suddenly appear, the driver would slam on the brakes. As soon as the car stopped, he would immediately lie under the wheels to demand money.

But he never expected the Maserati's reaction to be different from what he expected, completely unpredictable.

The driver was a very beautiful girl. Upon seeing someone suddenly appear in front of the car, she immediately screamed in fright. Not only did she not hit the brakes, but she even took both hands off the steering wheel to cover her eyes.

"What the heck is going on? If you're not braking, why are you covering your eyes? And what's with stepping on the accelerator?"

Seeing the Maserati charging like an unbridled wild horse, it was too late for Ye Bufan to dodge.

With a loud bang, he was knocked flying more than ten meters like a kite with a broken string. In mid-air, he felt all his bones break, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.

"Can't stage an accident with a female driver..."

This was his last thought before he lost consciousness.

After the accident, countless people gathered to watch, but no one noticed that the blood he spat out splashed onto an ancient jade pendant on his chest, which was instantly absorbed completely.

Ye Bufan was an orphan. When his mother adopted him, this pendant was the only keepsake, so he always wore it on his chest.

Dimly, he felt a warmth rising from his chest, followed by a loud bang in his mind. "My descendant, Ye Bufan, accept the inheritance of my Ancient Medical Sect!"

Then, an old Taoist in a green robe with white hair and beard appeared in his consciousness. "I am Ye Xiaoyao of the Ancient Medical Sect. You have received my inheritance; you must uphold the rules of my Ancient Medical Sect, help the world with your medicine, and practice medicine throughout the land."

Countless pieces of information then merged into his brain: martial arts techniques, medical skills, mysterious arts, and various other skills...

These pieces of information merged with his memories, becoming incredibly clear, as if they were innate.

At the same time, the ancient jade pendant on his chest grew hotter and hotter, eventually transforming into a powerful stream of energy that flowed into his body.

After entering his body, the energy quickly strengthened his muscles and bones, gradually repairing the severe injuries he had just sustained.

A wave of extreme comfort washed over him, and Ye Bufan soon fell into a deep sleep.

After an unknown period, he regained consciousness and opened his eyes to see a sterile white room. He was in a hospital ward.

What just happened? Was it a dream?

He instinctively touched his chest. The pendant was gone, leaving only a red string around his neck.

He had clearly been severely hit by a Maserati, but now he felt no pain at all. On the contrary, he felt better than ever, every muscle fiber bursting with strength.

All the medical skills, mystic arts, and martial arts he had learned in his mind were clear as day, each proving that it was not a dream, and he had indeed received the inheritance of the Ancient Medical Sect.

"You're awake!"

A surprised voice sounded in his ear, followed by a stunningly beautiful face appearing before him.

The woman had long, flowing hair, a flawless, exquisite face, and a curvaceous, enchanting figure that was truly beautiful to the extreme.

He couldn't help but stare. He had never seen such a beautiful woman in his life; even the beautified female celebrities on TV were no match.

"I'm so sorry, my name is Qin Chuchu. I just got my driver's license yesterday, and I didn't expect to hit you today!"

Only then did Ye Bufan remember that the apologetic girl in front of him was the owner of the Maserati.

He harbored no resentment towards her; he had actively staged the accident, so he couldn't blame her.

On the contrary, he was filled with gratitude. If he hadn't met this female driver, he wouldn't have received the inheritance of the Ancient Medical Sect.

Seeing that he didn't speak, Qin Chuchu continued, "Don't worry, I will take responsibility for hitting you. Just rest here and recover. I'll cover all the medical expenses until you're fully healed and discharged."

Seeing that the girl in front of him showed no arrogance typical of a rich young woman, Ye Bufan's impression of her improved greatly. He said, "Thank you, I'm fine."

"I was so scared yesterday, I actually knocked you so far away."

Qin Chuchu patted her heaving chest and said, "It's strange, though. The doctor said you were fine after the examination, just temporarily unconscious from a concussion.

"This is simply a miracle. My car had to be sent for major repairs, yet you're perfectly fine. It's unbelievable."

Hearing the word "unconscious," Ye Bufan was startled and eagerly asked, "How long have I been unconscious?"

Qin Chuchu said, "About half a day. The doctor originally said you wouldn't wake up until 24 hours later..."

"Half a day?"

Ye Bufan suddenly sat up. His mother was still fighting for her life in the hospital, and he couldn't afford to waste any more time here.

Now that he had received the inheritance of the Ancient Medical Sect, no one in the world could surpass his medical skills. He no longer needed other doctors to perform surgery; he could cure his mother's illness himself.

In his urgency, he grabbed Qin Chuchu's hand and eagerly asked, "Where is this?"

Qin Chuchu was startled by his reaction, even forgetting to pull her hand back. She instinctively said, "This is Central Hospital."

His mother was in Jiangnan Hospital, which was still some distance away. Ye Bufan jumped out of bed, put on his shoes, and rushed outside.

Qin Chuchu called out behind him, "Hey, where are you going? The doctor wants you to rest well..."

"I'm fine now, just get me discharged."

Ye Bufan said, and then darted out of Central Hospital, running towards Jiangnan Hospital. As he passed a pharmacy, he bought a packet of silver needles and put them in his pocket.

In the ICU ward of Jiangnan Hospital, chief physician Xie Haitao flipped open Ouyang Lan's eyelids, then looked at the instruments beside the bed, and said to nurse Zhang Xiaoman, "The patient is definitely dead. Proceed with the next steps."

"Understood, Dr. Xie."

Zhang Xiaoman replied, picking up a white sheet, preparing to cover the deceased.

Xie Haitao glanced at Ouyang Lan lying in bed, his eyes full of indifference, without any regret or guilt.

"If her family could pay the 50,000 yuan surgery fee, and I personally performed the surgery, there might have been a chance for her to live.

"But unfortunately, she's a pauper who can't even come up with such a small amount of money. Without money, she can only wait for death."

Just then, Ye Bufan rushed in from outside. Seeing the white sheet in Zhang Xiaoman's hand, he cried out, "Stop, what are you doing?"

Zhang Xiaoman was startled, stopping what she was doing, and said, "The patient is already dead..."

"Nonsense, my mom isn't dead!"

Ye Bufan had received the inheritance of the Ancient Medical Sect. With just one glance, he understood Ouyang Lan's condition perfectly. She was merely in a state of suspended animation before death, not truly dead.

He pushed Zhang Xiaoman aside, took out the silver needles from his pocket, and with lightning speed, he rapidly inserted silver needles into Ouyang Lan's body.
