<h1>Chapter 9: Million-Dollar Bounty</h1>

<p>After waiting for more than ten minutes, the clerk finally finished his game, put his phone on the counter, took a sip of tea, and then slowly said, "What medicine are you buying?"</p>
<p>Ye Bufan handed over the written prescription, and the clerk's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Many of the ingredients written on it were precious old medicinal materials, and for such a prescription, he would get at least several thousand yuan in commission.</p>
<p>He asked, "Are you sure you want to buy so many medicinal materials?"</p>
<p>Ye Bufan said, "Of course, I just don't know if you have all of them here."</p>
<p>"Of course we do. There's no medicinal material that our Bai Cao Tang doesn't have." The young clerk's attitude immediately improved, and he said with a beaming smile, "Little brother, please wait a moment, I'll get all the medicinal materials ready for you right away."</p>
<p>Soon, the clerk placed a pile of medicinal materials on the counter. Ye Bufan checked them one by one. The medicinal materials were complete and of good quality.</p>
<p>"What medicine are you buying for this price?" the young clerk said, dissatisfied. "How about this, if you don't have that much money, buy less. I can't just work for you for nothing."</p>
<p>Cao Xinghua didn't even look at him, and excitedly said to Ye Bufan, "Young man, are those two medicines on the wall written by you?"</p>
<p>The young clerk's smiling face instantly turned cold: "No money, if you don't have money, why are you pretending here? Are you messing with me?"</p>
<p>"Elder Cao, you're here."</p>
<p>The clerk shouted, "Bounties are for people to try, but not just any Tom, Dick, or Harry can come here and scribble. Do you think that 1 million is something anyone can get?</p>
<p>If you can complete the Huatuo Golden Formula, I'll be Huatuo himself in this life!"</p>
<p>Ye Bufan sneered, "Isn't this an open bounty? Since it's a bounty, people should be allowed to try."</p>
<p>He said somewhat awkwardly, "I'm sorry, I didn't bring that much money."</p>
<p>After seeing the bounty, Ye Bufan was overjoyed. He knew Cao Xinghua, the head of Bai Cao Tang, an elder of the traditional Chinese medicine community in Jiangnan City, a figure of great authority.</p>
<p>As for the Huatuo Golden Formula, he knew it even better.</p>
<p>Ye Bufan apologized again, "I'm sorry, I didn't bring enough money this time. I'll come back to buy it after I've gathered enough money."</p>
<p>"Ah...?"</p>
<p>He was worried about not having money to buy medicinal materials to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill, and now there was a million yuan bounty delivered to his doorstep.</p>
<p>He originally thought that the 30,000 yuan in his pocket was a huge sum, but now it wasn't even a fraction of what was needed. He hadn't expected that just one set of medicinal materials for refining the Foundation Establishment Pill would cost so much.</p>
<p>Liu Hong didn't notice the old man's expression, and kept chattering on the side.</p>
<p>The expected commission wasn't earned, and the young clerk was full of anger.</p>
<p>Before Ye Bufan could speak, Liu Hong interrupted and said, "He's the one who scribbled it. If I hadn't stopped him in time, he would have written the third ingredient too.</p>
<p>He looked down again and saw a section of text explaining: "I, Cao Xinghua, accidentally obtained the Huatuo Golden Formula, but unfortunately, it is incomplete, with three medicinal ingredients inaccurately recorded.</p>
<p>"Pah, pauper, who knows when you'll have enough money." The clerk angrily put away the medicinal materials. "It's my fault for being blind. Seeing you dressed like a beggar, I shouldn't have given you medicine."</p>
<p>Cao Xinghua angrily said again, "Did you hear that? Hurry up and apologize to this young man."</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he turned and walked out, when he suddenly saw a large red notice posted on the wall, with four big characters written on it: Million Dollar Bounty.</p>
<p>Cao Xinghua said this as he scanned the bounty notice. When he saw the two medicinal ingredients Ye Bufan had filled in, he immediately stood there dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"What's going on, making such a fuss in the store?"</p>
<p>Ye Bufan frowned, "What are you talking about? I already apologized for not bringing enough money. Besides, you're a clerk here, it's your duty to get me medicine. What's there to complain about?"</p>
<p>"You..."</p>
<p>One must know that there are at least tens of thousands of traditional Chinese medicinal ingredients in China. If one were to rely on luck to complete the remaining three ingredients, the probability would be countless times lower than winning the lottery.</p>
<p>"Elder Cao, this poor boy has no money and is making trouble in our store. He even scribbled on the bounty notice just now..."</p>
<p>According to the records in the ancient medical sect's inheritance, Huatuo came from the ancient medical sect, but he was not proficient in martial arts, only an outer disciple. This Huatuo Golden Formula was not created by Huatuo, but was passed down from the ancient medical sect.</p>
<p>The young clerk frowned and said, "Just changing the age of the medicinal materials, you know that medicinal materials that are ten years old and those that are two years old can differ in price by more than ten times."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're getting a temper now." The young clerk's temper immediately flared up. He patted his chest and said arrogantly, "Don't you see where this is? This is Bai Cao Tang, and our boss is Old Master Cao.</p>
<p>"I..." Although Liu Hong still didn't understand what was going on, he couldn't disobey Elder Cao's words, so he respectfully said, "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Upon seeing Cao Xinghua, the clerk named Liu Hong immediately turned into a fawning lapdog.</p>
<p>"Ah? That expensive?"</p>
<p>Just then, a dignified-looking old man walked over from the traditional Chinese medicine clinic.</p>
<p>Ye Bufan was about to get angry, but then thought better of it and vented his frustration. He was, after all, a inheritor of the ancient medical sect, there was no need to bother with such a snobbish villain.</p>
<p>Ye Bufan angrily said, "Isn't this a bounty? Why can't I write it down?"</p>
<p>If anyone can complete these three medicinal ingredients, and once I've verified them, I will offer one million Chinese Yuan as a reward."</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he picked up the pen prepared next to him and began to fill in the remaining three medicinal ingredients in the three blank spaces.</p>
<p>Every day, the people who come to our place for treatment are either rich or officials. Is this a place for a pauper like you to act like a big shot?"</p>
<p>Ye Bufan was startled. Although he also studied traditional Chinese medicine at Jiangnan Medical University, he didn't know much about the prices of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>"Hey, you pauper, are you endless? Who told you to scribble here?"</p>
<p>Ye Bufan said, "That won't do. These are the medicinal materials for one dose of medicine; less than that will be useless."</p>
<p>Liu Hong was completely dumbfounded, standing there with a bewildered expression.</p>
<p>He had just written down two medicinal ingredients when the young clerk rushed out from behind the counter and pushed him aside.</p>
<p>Ye Bufan said, "That's not allowed either. The medicinal materials I've prescribed are already of the lowest possible age."</p>
<p>Ye Bufan explained, "I'm sorry, I just didn't expect these medicinal materials to be so expensive."</p>
<p>Ever since this notice was posted, it initially attracted countless famous medical practitioners. Many people came here to try, but without exception, they all failed.</p>
<p>Being provoked time and again by this guy, even a clay Buddha would get angry. Ye Bufan angrily said, "What do you want to do?"</p>
<p>The prescription he listed was only for one dose of the Foundation Establishment Pill; insufficient dosage would render it impossible to refine the pill.</p>
<p>He said, "How much does it cost?"</p>
<p>The clerk picked up an abacus and clacked away for a while, then said, "The total is 253,200 yuan. Cash or card?"</p>
<p>Before Liu Hong could finish speaking, Cao Xinghua slapped him across the face, "You scoundrel, apologize to this young man immediately."</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the young clerk immediately erupted, "This won't do, that won't do, you're just messing with me, aren't you?"</p>
<p>The clerk shouted, "I'm talking about you! Do you know what kind of place this is? This is Bai Cao Tang, is this a place where you can just scribble whatever you want?"</p>
<p>Below the explanation was the prescription for the Huatuo Golden Formula, but only the first 15 ingredients were listed, with three blank spaces marked at the end, apparently waiting for someone to complete them.</p>
<p>Even Old Master Cao couldn't complete this formula, and so many famous traditional Chinese medicine doctors had failed. He absolutely did not believe that this poor young man in front of him could do it.</p>
<p>Although this person's hair was already white, his complexion was rosy, and he appeared full of energy and vigor. He was indeed Old Master Cao Xinghua, the head of Bai Cao Tang.</p>
<p>"Liu Hong, what's all the noise about?"</p>
<p>Old Cao, please don't be angry, I'll wipe it off right away..."</p>
<p>The clerk said scornfully, "Are you crazy for money? A million dollar bounty is nice, but what does it have to do with you?"</p>
<p>Ye Bufan said coldly, "Today I've truly witnessed what it means for a big store to bully customers. 'Repairing and compounding as if no one sees, but heaven knows the intention' means that TCM practitioners should not deceive themselves or others. Your Bai Cao Tang is simply unworthy of this saying!"</p>
<p>"Little brother, I'm sorry, it's my usual lack of strict discipline as an old man. I sincerely apologize to you again here."</p>
<p>After apologizing, Cao Xinghua said eagerly, "Little brother, can you really complete this Huatuo Golden Formula?"</p>
