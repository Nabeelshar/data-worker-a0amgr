<h1>Chapter 7: Ghost in the Wall</h1>

<p>After he finished his cigarette on the third floor, Liu Jianjun retrieved the braised food hanging at someone's doorway and continued to climb the stairs. This time, he decided to count his steps. There were 11 steps per floor, so to get from the third floor to the fifth, he would pass the halfway point of the third floor, the fourth floor, the halfway point of the fourth floor, and finally the fifth floor! This meant that, under normal circumstances, he only needed to walk 44 more steps to reach home.</p>

<p>"1, 2, 3..." Liu Jianjun walked upwards, silently counting his steps in his mind. He didn't stop until he reached 44.</p>

<p>He stomped his foot to turn on the stairwell light and looked up at the door number. 301! He was still on the third floor! Even the cigarette butt he had carelessly tossed at the stairwell corner was still lying there.</p>

<p>"Answer the phone, answer the phone!" At this point, Liu Jianjun knew something was wrong. He pulled out his phone, dialed my number, and repeatedly urged into the receiver. Facing criminals, even murderers, wouldn't faze him. But what was this situation? Liu Jianjun felt a sense of fear, a feeling he hadn't experienced since he put on his police uniform.</p>

<p>"Damn it, answer the phone!" A busy tone came from the phone. He pressed the redial button repeatedly, stomping his foot and urging the call.</p>

<p>"Yi ya, yi ya!" Just as Liu Jianjun pressed the redial button for the second time, a child's babbling sound came from downstairs. He leaned his head out to look down the stairs but found no one there.</p>

<p>"Yi ya, yi ya!" When he pulled back, the child's voice sounded again from behind him.</p>

<p>"Who's there!" The stairwell light also went out at this moment. Liu Jianjun reached for his pistol at his waist, stomped his foot, and shouted. This time, the light did not come on.</p>

<p>"Yi ya, ya!" In the darkness, Liu Jianjun felt a cold body press against him. Then he felt something, a cold object, entering his body through his nostrils.</p>

<p>"Ahh!" As that thing entered his body, Liu Jianjun immediately felt an extremely intense hunger welling up in his heart. He reached out and tore open his police uniform, clawing at his chest with his fingernails. He had an urge, a desire to eat the flesh off his own body. It seemed that only by eating his own flesh could he stop this intense hunger.</p>

<p>"Ess..." Liu Jianjun tore at his clothes, reaching for the area of his heart. Unintentionally, he pulled out the protective charm that was in his upper pocket. The hexagram-folded charm suddenly made a sound, then spontaneously combusted out of thin air.</p>

<p>"Yi ya~" As the amulet burned, the surrounding temperature also rose. A shrill shriek came from Liu Jianjun's mouth, and then a black shadow emerged from his facial orifices, flowing along the base of the wall and out. Yes, flowing out. Like a puddle of black water, it disappeared down the stairs in a few moments.</p>

<p>"Puchi!" As the black shadow left his body, Liu Jianjun regained control of it. Although the black shadow had not taken his life, it had caused him some injury. After spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, he slowly sat down on the ground, leaning against the wall. Liu Jianjun felt as if his entire body had been hollowed out by something just now.</p>

<p>After a long while, he regained consciousness. Looking at the completely burned-out amulet in front of him, he propped up his weakened body and dialed my number. This time, the phone was no longer busy.</p>

<p>"Come to my place now!" After the call connected, Liu Jianjun said in a hurry.</p>

<p>"So it found him after all? Vengeance for injustice, retribution for hatred, I don't care what you do. But you shouldn't involve others." Listening to Liu Jianjun's weak voice on the phone, I felt a whiff of blood. Hanging up, I went up to the attic and took down the few Taoist talismans that had long been prepared and offered before the Sanqing statues.</p>

<p>"Mom, I'm home." Holding his torn police uniform in a crumpled ball, Liu Jianjun opened the door with the braised food. As soon as he entered, he saw his elderly mother watching a soap opera on the sofa. He suppressed his physical discomfort and greeted the elder, then went into the kitchen to prepare dinner.</p>

<p>"Junzi's back?" The elder sat there watching TV, completely unaware of her son's unusual state.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's been some progress on the case, so I don't have to work overtime today. I bought some braised food on the way; we'll have extra dishes for dinner." Liu Jianjun hid the police uniform from his mother, throwing it into the trash can. Then he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt and started preparing dinner. There were a few bloodstains on his shirt, left from when he scratched himself just now. These bloodstains told him that everything that had just happened was real.</p>

<p>"Just eat something simple, you haven't been back for days. Take a shower later and get some rest early. You'll be back at work tomorrow, and who knows when you'll be home again." The old woman doted on her son; he was in his forties, and when he worked overtime, there was no telling when he'd stop. She worried that if this continued, her son's health would break down.</p>

<p>"Bang bang bang!" After Liu Jianjun placed the dishes on the table, someone knocked on the door.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" After he opened the door, I walked in with my hands in my pockets. I sniffed lightly, detecting a faint scent of blood coming from Liu Jianjun, and softly asked.</p>

<p>“Almost wasn’t, thanks to that charm you gave me. Otherwise, tomorrow you’d find me having eaten myself.” Liu Jianjun, having calmed down, joked with me.</p>

<p>"How have you been lately, Auntie?" I walked up to Liu Jianjun's mother and bent down to ask.</p>

<p>"I'm doing great. Haven't had dinner yet, young man? Come eat with us." The old woman didn't remember what had happened to her, so she had no impression of me either.</p>

<p>"Not yet!" I helped the old woman to the dining table, pulled out a chair, and waited for her to sit down before speaking.</p>

<p>"You're certainly not polite!" Liu Jianjun served me a bowl of rice and said.</p>

<p>“No need to be with you.” I picked up two chopsticks full of vegetables and started eating my rice right there.</p>

<p>"Don't forget to pick me up from the shop tomorrow night." After dinner, Liu Jianjun's mother continued watching her soap opera, while I leaned in behind Liu Jianjun, who was washing dishes, to instruct him. Tomorrow would be Yang Cuihua's seventh day, and only from her could I learn the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>"Hmm, I won't forget," Liu Jianjun replied, enduring the pain from his chest wound.</p>

<p>"Apply a bit later; it works better than regular wound medicine." I pulled a small ball of incense ash wrapped in yellow paper from my pocket and placed it on the cutting board, saying.</p>

<p>"Incense ashes? Are they reliable? Don't let them infect my wound." Liu Jianjun picked up the paper packet, sniffed it under his nose, then stared at me with doubt.</p>

<p>"If you don't want it, I'll take it back. You know this is a treasure I get from burning incense and offering sacrifices to the Three Pure Ones day and night. Others paying for it might not even get it, but I'm giving it to you for free, and you don't want it?" As I spoke, I made to take the incense ash back.</p>

<p>"There's no reason to take back something that's been given out. I'll apply it later," Liu Jianjun quickly countered, slipping the paper packet into his pocket. Before, he would have scoffed at such superstitious things. However, ever since his mother's possession incident, he had begun to revere ghosts and spirits. The recent events that happened to him personally made him feel even more strongly that there was a logical reason and historical basis for ghost and spirit folklore to have circulated for thousands of years in China.</p>
