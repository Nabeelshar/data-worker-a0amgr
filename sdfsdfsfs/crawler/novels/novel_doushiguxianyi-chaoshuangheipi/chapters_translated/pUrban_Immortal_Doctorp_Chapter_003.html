<h1><p>Chapter 3 You're Not Fit to Be a Doctor</p></h1>

"Quickly put the child on the bed and start emergency treatment immediately."

Hearing the instruction from the head of the Municipal Health Bureau, Xie Haitao dared not neglect it. He had the middle-aged man place the little boy on the ICU bed.

Seeing the little boy's ashen face, rapid breathing, and unconscious state, indicating a grave situation, Ye Bufan said nothing more.

The matter of medical fees would be resolved eventually; there was no need to rush now.

As Xie Haitao examined the little boy, he asked, "How did the child get sick?"

The middle-aged man said, "My son was fine when he came home from school, but after a while, he said he felt unwell. Soon, he developed a high fever, and then fell into a coma."

After examining him, Xie Haitao said, "Don't worry, it's just a common cold, but the fever is a bit severe. I'll give him some fever-reducing medicine now, and he'll be fine soon."

Ye Bufan, having inherited the Ancient Medical Sect's legacy, couldn't just stand by and watch someone die.

But now it was different; he could entirely shift this responsibility.

Noticing the time was right, Ye Bufan took out another silver needle and pricked the little boy's two index fingers, squeezing out two drops of black blood, which he let fall into the nearby trash can.

The middle-aged man breathed a sigh of relief, nodding repeatedly and saying, "Yes, yes, Doctor Xie is indeed a主任, his medical skills are excellent."

The middle-aged man immediately cried out nervously, "Doctor, what's wrong? What's happened to my son?"

But at that moment, the little boy's tender face suddenly contorted, his limbs began to convulse, white foam constantly frothed from his mouth, and the monitor beside the bed emitted a harsh beeping sound.

Seeing his son wake up, the middle-aged man exclaimed with joy, "A medical prodigy, truly a medical prodigy!"

Zhou Yongliang asked in surprise, "You cured him?"

"Little medical prodigy, thank you for saving my son!" The middle-aged man took out two stacks of hundred-yuan bills and pressed them into Ye Bufan's hand. "Little medical prodigy, thank you!"

Xie Haitao said smugly, "See? I told you it was just a small cold, nothing serious."

Seeing his superior approach, he whispered a threat, "Kid, you'd better keep your mouth shut. Practicing medicine illegally is a serious crime,至少 to five or six years in prison. I'm helping you cover this up now."

Xie Haitao was also startled. According to his diagnosis, the little boy had a common cold, so how could such a situation suddenly occur?

The middle-aged man cried out anxiously, "Doctor, find a solution quickly! He's my only son!"

Xie Haitao felt frustrated and angry. He looked at Ye Bufan and shouted, "Are you a doctor? Who told you to treat him?"

Xie Haitao was at a loss; he had no idea what was happening, so how could he find a solution?

Seeing the little boy's condition become increasingly critical, the middle-aged man roared furiously, "You quack! If anything happens to my son, I'll make you pay with your life!"

He knew Xie Haitao, and in his impression, he was just an ordinary chief physician, not particularly skilled in medicine.

Seeing that the little boy was about to die, if he truly caused a death, not only would he lose his title as director, but he would probably also end up in jail.

"What do you know? Are you treating the patient or am I? Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand."

The middle-aged man asked, "Is this person also a doctor in your emergency room?"

This was the rule of the Ancient Medical Sect: the consultation fee was by fate. Even a golden mountain would not be too much, and not a penny would not be too little.

As he spoke, he was about to rush forward to fight, but then suddenly noticed that the little boy's convulsing limbs had stopped, he had also stopped foaming at the mouth, his face slowly turned rosy, and even the monitoring equipment at the head of the bed returned to normal.

As time passed, a faint flush of color slowly appeared on the little boy's face, and his pain seemed to have lessened considerably.

While Xie Haitao was speaking, Zhou Yongliang, director of the Health Bureau, and Ma Haidong, president of Jiangnan Hospital, walked in from outside.

Ye Bufan was not polite, he took the money and handed it to Ouyang Lan.

Having just been exposed for his shameful behavior, Xie Haitao had been simmering with anger, which he immediately unleashed now.

"Shouldn't you be thanking me?" Ye Bufan said, "Someone like you, who has neither medical ethics nor medical skills, truly doesn't deserve to be a doctor."

If observed carefully, one would notice that after these silver needles were inserted into the acupuncture points, their tails would gently vibrate, as if some power kept them constantly moving.

Ye Bufan said, "He's infected with a certain virus. Has he recently come into contact with anything unclean, such as mice or other animals carrying a large number of germs?"

The middle-aged man said, "I don't think so. He didn't go out today; he was at school."

He came to the bedside and said, "I told you long ago that you were mistaken. This isn't a cold at all, but poisoning."

Because he didn't know the person's relationship with Director Zhou, he spoke very politely.

The middle-aged man asked, "Little medical prodigy, what disease does my son have?"

The middle-aged man breathed a sigh of relief. "That's great. Thank you, doctor."

Having said that, he picked up a syringe and personally injected the little boy with an antipyretic.

After he said that, he ran over with a fawning expression: "Director Zhou, President Ma, the two leaders are here."

"What are you doing?" Xie Haitao was about to step forward to stop him, but then he suddenly had an idea and stopped, shouting, "Interfering with my treatment of the patient, whatever consequences arise will be your responsibility!"

"Yes, Director Zhou, I cured him."

Originally, I could have cured this illness, but now that he's made it like this, it has nothing to do with me." The middle-aged man immediately jumped up: "What right do you, a patient's family member, have to treat my son..."

As he spoke, he felt a sense of relief; it seemed the little boy's father hadn't spoken directly to Director Zhou, which made things easier.

"Mind your own business. You're practicing medicine illegally; do you believe I'll call the police and have you arrested?"

Zhou Yongliang asked, "Where's the patient I assigned? Has he arrived?"

Ouyang Lan still hadn't fully recovered; how did her son become a medical prodigy after she fell ill once? And he earned so much money in the blink of an eye.

Ye Bufan paid no attention, continuing to apply acupuncture to the little boy to expel the toxins.

"I..."

Ye Bufan said, "I have already drained the toxic blood. Just drink some mung bean water when you go home, and you'll be completely fine. In the future, never let the child come into contact with those unclean wild animals."

"This... what's going on?"

"Let me."

Xie Haitao took the antipyretic medicine prepared by Zhang Xiaoman and was about to inject it into the little boy.

Xie Haitao said, "He's not a doctor; he's just a family member of the patient.

He then retrieved all the silver needles, and the little boy opened his eyes, sat up from the bed, and looked around in a daze.

Xie Haitao said, "Are you referring to the child with a fever? I've already cured him, and he just left here."

Blood pressure dropped, heartbeat rapidly slowed, seemingly in critical condition at any moment.

With that, he took out the silver needles from his pocket and inserted them one by one into the major acupuncture points on the little boy's chest.

Ye Bufan shook his head and said, "He doesn't have a cold at all. Using a fever-reducing injection will worsen his condition."

Everyone watched, stunned, especially Xie Haitao. He thought Ye Bufan curing Ouyang Lan was just a fluke, but he never expected him to save this little boy as well.

Regardless, no one died, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

The middle-aged man carried the little boy on his back, turned back, and spat fiercely at Xie Haitao, "Quack! And a chief doctor, my foot!"

As Xie Haitao spoke, he turned back and gave Ye Bufan a warning look.

Seeing this guy's shamelessness reach such a degree, Ye Bufan was about to step forward and expose him, but Ouyang Lan stopped him.

She knew that her son indeed did not have a medical license, and going to the police station would be troublesome.
