<h1><h1 class="title">Chapter 11: Nine Soul-Returning Needles</h1></h1>

"What? Hua Tuo's Golden Formula doesn't cure illness?"

Cao Xinghua's expression immediately changed dramatically. "Little brother, you must be mistaken. Many ancient books record Hua Tuo's Golden Formula, stating very clearly that it is a golden formula that can be used for vicious diseases."

"You are all mistaken," Ye Bufan said, shaking his head.

The famous Ma Fei San (cannabis powder) and Hua Tuo's Golden Formula were two prescriptions that came from an ancient medical sect. As a successor of an ancient medical sect, how could he not know the efficacy of Hua Tuo's Golden Formula?

He further explained, "Hua Tuo's Golden Formula can be used for vicious diseases, that's not wrong, but its meaning is not to cure vicious diseases, but to help late-stage patients relieve pain.

In terms of function, it is similar to Ma Fei San, except that Ma Fei San is used for surgery, while it is used for pain relief in the late stages of critically ill patients.

To put it plainly, it is just a painkiller prescription that can be used for various ailments, including pain relief for late-stage cancer patients. It is much better than the painkillers currently used by cancer patients, and it has no addiction or side effects."

Cao Xinghua drove out an Audi A6, and the two left Baitang Hall and headed to Jiangnan Ruhua Community, the most famous community in Jiangnan City.

"What? What did you say?"

Cao Xinghua saw what he was thinking and said, "Don't underestimate Little Ye's youth, but his medical skills are far superior to mine. Let's go, let's go see old He."

The He family's villa was Building No. 1, the best in Jiangnan Ruhua Community. It was a separate courtyard with three European-style small buildings.

However, Cao Qinghua was overjoyed. He had been trying for so long to find a cure, and a 80% chance was unimaginable for him.

His words were both a question and a mild test, wanting to see if Ye Bufan was boasting.

But he had placed all his hopes of curing his old friend on Hua Tuo's Golden Formula. Now that this prescription could only relieve pain and not fundamentally cure the illness, what would he use to save someone?

"Uncle Cao, you're here." He Tianqi said with a worried face, "I was just about to call you, sir. My father's condition has been getting worse these past few days. Please, take a look at him quickly."

The fact that Ye Bufan possessed the complete Hua Tuo's Golden Formula showed the extraordinary nature of his sect, and this gave him a glimmer of hope.

Ye Bufan called out, but felt quite amused. This old man was already so old, why was he still so agitated?

Upon hearing the words "Huihun Nine Needles," Cao Xinghua's hands trembled in shock, and the car veered off course, almost colliding with a large truck coming from the opposite direction.

Entering the ward, Ye Bufan saw an old man with white hair and beard lying on the hospital bed, emaciated and pale, currently in a coma.

Ye Bufan said, "Of course I wouldn't lie to you, sir. This needle technique is indeed in our sect's inheritance."

Legend has it that if one can use the Huihun Nine Needles, even a dead person can be brought back to life, leaving the two grim reapers, Hei Bai Wuchang, helpless.

Cao Xinghua drove and asked, "Little brother, what method are you preparing to use to treat my old friend?"

And this formula can effectively relieve this kind of pain. Those who have experienced that kind of suffering know how valuable this medicine is, so it is called the Golden Formula."

"According to what Elder Cao just said, the most suitable method for this condition would be the Huihun Nine Needles."

"This..."

Because of this, the He family had a strong say throughout Jiangnan City.

As Ye Bufan described, the efficacy of this medicine was also extremely precious.

Cao Xinghua looked incredulous. "This is impossible. If it can't cure illness, why is it called Hua Tuo's Golden Formula?"

"Oh my god, you actually know the Huihun Nine Needles, you're not lying to an old man, are you?"

Cao Xinghua suddenly had full confidence in Ye Bufan, restarted the car, and sped forward.

"Other methods?" Cao Xinghua's heart suddenly stirred. "Little brother, can you cure my old friend's illness?"

Cao Xinghua was completely dumbfounded. The previous prescription was incomplete, so he couldn't determine the properties and efficacy of the medicine, which ultimately led him to misinterpret the ancient records.

"Excellent, truly excellent! With the Nine Needles of Soul Revival, Old He's life can finally be saved."

Ye Bufan said, "For some critically ill patients, such as those with advanced cancer or pancreatitis, the pain is absolutely unbearable.

The He family in Jiangnan is absolutely an admired presence among all upper-class society.

His three sons were all exceptionally outstanding. The eldest son, He Tianming, joined the army and already had shining stars on his shoulders. The second son, He Tianda, entered politics and was a prominent official in Jiangnan Province.

He Changqing, the patriarch of the He family, once fought alongside the founding father to establish the nation, achieving countless military exploits for China. He is one of the few remaining elder statesmen today, possessing immense influence in Jiangnan City and even throughout China.

"Don't worry, I brought Little Ye today to treat old He."

Although He Tianqi was a bit skeptical of Ye Bufan, he had to show respect to Elder Cao. He led the two of them to a three-story house.

Cao Xinghua, however, was overjoyed and said excitedly, "Little brother, are you sure you can cure him? How confident are you?"

"This... how is this even possible?"

The third son, He Tianqi, went into business and already became incredibly wealthy.

Ye Bufan nodded and said, "Yes."

Ye Bufan nodded. This old man was so concerned about his friend's illness, which showed he was a man of passion. There was no harm in him helping out.

"Yes, is there a problem?"

Ye Bufan's statement was very humble. The other party merely had a lung disease, which was nothing in the face of the ancient medical sect's inheritance.

Cao Xinghua was clearly very familiar with the place, as the bodyguards at the gate did not stop him.

Seeing his crestfallen expression, Ye Bufan comforted him, "Old Cao, you don't have to worry too much. Although Hua Tuo's Golden Formula cannot cure the disease, we can still think of other methods."

Although this was a private hospital, the medical conditions were no worse than those of large hospitals.

No wonder Cao Xinghua was so excited. The Huihun Nine Needles were hailed as the most remarkable needle technique in the history of Traditional Chinese Medicine, once having the renowned reputation of "Huihun appears, Wuchang cries."

Cao Xinghua introduced Ye Bufan to He Tianqi, saying, "This is Dr. Ye Bufan."

"Great, little brother, please trouble you to come with me to diagnose my old friend."

"Ah?" He Tianqi looked bewildered. In the past, Cao Xinghua often brought some famous TCM doctors to treat his father, but those people were all old men over sixty. When did such a young TCM doctor appear?

Upon entering, a middle-aged man around 40 years old greeted them. It was He Changqing's third son, He Tianqi.

Cao Xinghua slammed on the brakes, stopping by the roadside, then pulled Ye Bufan's hand and said, "Little brother, what did you just say? Is it really the Huihun Nine Needles?"

Fortunately, Ye Bufan reacted quickly and pushed the steering wheel, thus averting disaster. "Elder Cao, be careful!"

It was his first time meeting Ye Bufan, and he didn't fully trust him. The only reason he invited him to treat his old friend was out of desperation, having no other better option.

"Eighty percent!"

Cao Xinghua, familiar with the place, quickly led Ye Bufan into a separate three-story building, which was the He family's private hospital.

He Tianqi anxiously said, "Uncle Cao, please help my father quickly."

Cao Xinghua then looked at Ye Bufan: "Little Ye, quickly go and examine old He."

Ye Bufan nodded, stepping towards He Changqing's bed. Just as he was about to reach out to take his pulse, he heard someone behind him shout, "Stop! Don't touch my grandpa!"
