<h1>Chapter 10: Hua Tuo's Golden Formula</h1>

Ye Bufan said, "That's right, I happen to know this prescription."

"That's great, young man, please help me complete the prescription. The 1 million yuan prize money will not be reduced by a single cent."

Cao Xinghua's beard trembled with excitement. From the two medicinal ingredients Ye Bufan had already filled in, he could tell that this young man was not simple.

He had studied this prescription countless times and tried countless medicinal ingredients, but their medicinal properties simply couldn't match the previous fifteen.

But the current two ingredients were completely different. They perfectly matched the previous fifteen ingredients, and were likely two of the three missing ingredients.

Ye Bufan shook his head and said, "I'm sorry, I was going to fill it in just now, but your Baicaotang people said that not just anyone can write here. It seems our缘分 (fate) is not enough, please find someone else."

With that, he turned to leave, but Cao Xinghua grabbed his wrist. "Young man, don't go, please don't go."

After stopping Ye Bufan, he turned to Liu Hong and angrily said, "You scoundrel, how dare you speak to this young man like that? Apologize to him immediately!"

"Don't be angry, old sir, I'll go now."

As he spoke, he looked eager.

Only one word "Bai" on the incomplete prescription was clear, the last word was too blurry to read. He speculated for a long time and thought it should be "Bai Zhi", but he was wrong after all.

"Oh." A hint of regret flashed in Cao Xinghua's eyes, and then he said, "Young man, you helped me complete Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription, now it's time for this old man to fulfill his promise."

Ye Bufan being able to do this at such a young age, it was clear that his master was an extraordinary person, which immediately made him want to befriend him.

The ingredient in Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription is "Bai Zhu", not "Bai Zhi". Although they are similar, their medicinal properties are quite different."

Seeing Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription completed on the wall, Cao Xinghua trembled with excitement. This prescription was obtained by chance, but due to its extreme age, many of the characters on it were illegible, making it an incomplete prescription.

Liu Hong got up from the ground, profusely thanking him.

As the doyen of traditional Chinese medicine in Jiangnan, since Old Master Cao had already gone to such lengths, Ye Bufan naturally couldn't say anything more.

"What is this talk? The old man said no to money, isn't that slapping my face?" Cao Xinghua said, "Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription is priceless, an extra 200,000 yuan is nothing.

"It's complete, it's finally complete!"

He waved his hand and said, "Alright, get up."

Ye Bufan had a good impression of this old man. As an elder in the field of traditional Chinese medicine, he had no airs, was straightforward, and suited his temperament very well.

Thinking this, he plopped down on his knees before Ye Bufan, raised his hand, and slapped himself twice across the face. "I'm sorry, I was a snob.

Cao Xinghua was excited for a while, then took the prescription off the wall, and his expression suddenly changed.

Cao Xinghua excitedly said, "Young man, what is your distinguished name, and from whom did you learn?"

And you've helped me a great deal this time. I gathered Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription because I needed to save an old friend's life. If it were a few days later, it would truly be too late."

Ye Bufan sighed. For such a person, why did he have to be like this in the first place?

"I……"

Liu Hong, who was standing by, couldn't help but feel a flicker of thought. He had known that this young man couldn't complete Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription. When the old master gave the order, he would immediately confiscate those medicines worth more than 200,000 yuan.

Liu Hong was completely dumbfounded. The treatment at Baicaotang was the highest in the entire Jiangnan pharmaceutical industry, and with Cao Qinghua's prestige in traditional Chinese medicine, if he was fired from here, no one would probably ever hire him again, which would mean losing his job completely.

The reward notice had been posted for so long, and besides Ye Bufan, no one else could even match a single herb. If he left now, where would he find someone?

"Thank you, young man, thank you!"

Cao Xinghua said again, "Didn't the young man come to buy medicine just now? No matter what medicine it is, it's all free of charge."

Ye Bufan said calmly, "Old Cao is right, these two herbs cannot be used at the same time, but the mistake is not San Ye Zhi Lan, but the previous herb, Bai Zhi."

After replacing "Bai Zhi" with "Bai Zhu," the entire medical theory of the prescription became completely coherent, without any flaws.

Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription itself was a priceless treasure, and it concerned the life or death of an important figure, which was why he was willing to offer a million-dollar reward.

Liu Hong quickly ran to the counter and brought over all the packed medicine.

He had previously consulted countless famous traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, but no one could complete Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription.

The announcement had been posted for several days, but many people were powerless. Just when he was completely disappointed and about to withdraw the announcement, he met this young man.

"My name is Ye Bufan, and my master was a reclusive master who has already passed away."

After pondering for a moment, he said, "Young man, there's something wrong with this prescription. The medicinal properties of 'San Ye Zhi Lan' and the preceding 'Bai Zhi' conflict, and the two herbs cannot be used at the same time."

"Bai Zhu! It really is Bai Zhu! Now everything makes sense."

"Ah?" Liu Hong said, "Old Cao, those medicinal herbs add up to over 200,000 yuan..."

Liu Hong was disappointed on the side, but also extremely surprised. Who was this young man? He could actually advise Old Master Cao on traditional Chinese medicine, which was unprecedented. It seemed that this person must never be offended in the future.

My family has elders and children, all depending on me. Please, just forgive me this once!"

He was intimately familiar with the properties of traditional Chinese medicines and immediately spotted the discrepancies in the formula.

As an expert in traditional Chinese medicine, Cao Xinghua naturally wouldn't believe whatever others said. He carefully studied the prescription for a while longer, and then a look of sudden realization appeared on his face.

He called over the manager from the clinic and had a million-yuan check delivered to Ye Bufan.

This time, in order to treat that important figure and also to make up for the regret in his heart, he offered 1 million yuan as a reward.

Knowing the preciousness of Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription, he expended much effort to determine the first fifteen ingredients, but the last three were simply impossible to complete.

"Young man, you are indeed a master. This old man genuinely admires you."

However, since he had inherited the ancient medical sect's legacy, his knowledge and vision had ascended to another level, and he couldn't be bothered to quibble with such a small potato.

Just now, he was still thinking about getting a kickback, but now, not only did he not charge a single cent and gave everything away, but he also almost lost his job. If he had known this, why would he have provoked him in the first place?

Thinking this, he brought the medicinal herbs to Ye Bufan.

"Bai Zhu?"

Ye Bufan accepted the check and said, "Old Cao, I can't accept unearned rewards. Let's deduct the cost of those medicinal herbs from the prize money."

Cao Xinghua shouted, "I told you to go, so go! What's with all the nonsense!"

Now that he had finally found someone who could complete Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription, he would absolutely not let go.

He picked up a pen and completed the last remaining ingredient—San Ye Zhi Lan.

I'm telling you, if the young man doesn't forgive you, you're fired today!"

Cao Xinghua said, "Young man, consider these herbs as my apology to you, and please help me complete Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription."

Ye Bufan's expression was calm; this so-called Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription was quite ordinary in the ancient medical school, not some extraordinary formula.

He said, "Old Cao, are you trying to treat someone with Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription?"

Cao Xinghua nodded and said, "That's right, an old friend of mine has a serious lung disease. Countless famous doctors have been stumped. If Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription isn't completed soon, he probably won't live for more than two or three days."

Ye Bufan frowned and said, "Old sir, you're mistaken. Hua Tuo's Golden Prescription cannot cure diseases at all."
