<h1>Chapter 4: Impersonation</h1>

Zhou Yongliang asked again, "Is it a temporary relief of symptoms, or a complete cure?"

Xie Haitao said, "A complete cure, absolutely a complete cure. This child has no problems now, and the family is very satisfied with the treatment effect."

"Dr. Xie, I didn't expect your medical skills to be so good."

Zhou Yongliang didn't know what the truth was, and said to Ma Haidong with a beaming smile, "Director Ma, your hospital has a master."

Xie Haitao said with a happy face, "Director Zhou is flattering me. As a doctor, this is my duty."

He spoke modestly, but in his heart, he was ecstatic. Being appreciated by the head of the Bureau of Health meant a promising future for him.

There was still a vacancy for a vice dean in the hospital now, and it might be his.

As the mother and son were chatting, there was a sudden screech of brakes at the hospital entrance, and two black luxury cars stopped in front of the door.

Although he was the head of a bureau, the other party's status was also unusual - Dong Tianda, chairman of Jiangnan Tianda Group, a magnate in the catering industry.

Seeing his expression, Ma Haidong asked, "What's wrong, Dr. Xie, is there a problem?"

Xie Haitao said, "Dean, Western medicine currently has no effective medicine for this viral infection. It can only be treated with acupuncture."

Dong Tianda said, "Dr. Xie, if you can cure my son, Tianda Group will surely reward you handsomely!"

Zhou Yongliang told the nurse to put the little boy on the emergency bed, then turned to Xie Haitao and said, "Dr. Xie, hurry up and treat Young Master Dong."

A middle-aged man got out of the car, and four black-clad bodyguards behind him carried a stretcher, on which lay an unconscious little boy.

Zhou Yongliang praised, "Dr. Xie is indeed extraordinary, proficient in both Chinese and Western medicine. Hurry up and treat him. The next child is probably arriving soon."

To steal his credit, one must have the ability. Let's see how he handles this later.

"Mr. Dong, you've arrived."

Ma Haidong said, "If you have something to discuss, please go outside. This is the ICU, and outsiders are not allowed to enter casually."

Xie Haitao's forehead was dripping with cold sweat. He had just claimed Ye Bufan's credit, so how could he know how to cure this disease?

Tianda Group had a pivotal influence. From the top-tier Yushanfang Grand Restaurant in Jiangnan City to the humble roadside food stalls, half of them belonged to the Dong family.

Then he made another call: "Deputy Director Zhao, immediately notify the other hospitals to transfer all children with this special disease to Jiangnan Hospital. Dr. Xie Haitao here has found an effective treatment method."

As one needle was inserted, the little boy's body trembled. With the insertion of the second silver needle, his expression became incomparably pained.

Naturally, Zhou Yongliang was extremely polite to such an important figure.

I will distribute the infected children to various hospitals in Jiangnan City for treatment, hoping that someone can cure this disease.

Dong Tianda not only possessed billions in assets but also had an impressive background, donating seven-figure sums to the health industry annually.

"Uh..."

I believe that acupuncture performed with the same technique should be able to cure this disease.

At this moment, Ma Haidong saw Ye Bufan and Ouyang Lan standing by, and asked, "What's wrong with these two people?"

While dreaming sweet dreams, he took out the prepared silver needles and approached the little boy's bedside.

Xie Haitao took a deep breath, replayed Ye Bufan's acupuncture scene in his mind, then took out a silver needle and stabbed towards the Shencang acupoint on the little boy's chest.

The implicit meaning was that as long as he wasn't exposed on the spot, the medical bill would be negotiable.

"No... no... no problem."

Zhou Yongliang said nothing more, pulled out his phone and dialed a number: "Mr. Dong, I have good news for you. Dr. Xie of Jiangnan Hospital has cured this disease. Bring your son here right away."

He had studied some traditional Chinese medicine before and knew a little about acupuncture. Moreover, when Ye Bufan treated the little boy just now, he was by his side and remembered the acupuncture points clearly.

"Yes, Director."

His good luck had arrived. If he could cure Dong Tianda's son, he would not only gain the appreciation of his superiors but also receive substantial benefits. This was a win-win situation of fame and fortune.

Ma Haidong asked in surprise, "Dr. Xie, what are you doing?"

He also said to Xie Haitao, "Dr. Xie, if you can cure all these children, I will give you a great merit."

Xie Haitao was completely dumbfounded. He had thought there was only one special case, and that he could just claim the credit, but he didn't expect so many follow-up patients.

Xie Haitao hurriedly said, "They are the patients and family members who have just been cured, waiting to discuss the medical expenses with me."

Ma Haidong didn't know what exactly happened, and asked, "Director Zhou, what's going on? How can there be so many similar cases?"

However, at this moment, Dong Tianda was in no mood for pleasantries, and said anxiously, "Director Zhou, quickly find a doctor to treat my son. He has a high fever of 40 degrees, and I'm afraid if it lasts too long, it will affect his intelligence."

"I wouldn't say proficient, I just coincidentally saw a needling technique in a medical book that happens to be able to treat this disease."

It was initially determined to be an infection with a new type of virus, which was not recorded in the national virus database, and there was no effective drug for it.

"Mr. Dong, don't worry, everything is ready."

He brought his mother to the ICU ward and found a long bench to sit on. Ouyang Lan said, "Son, we have 20,000 yuan now. Let's talk to Dr. Xie later and see if we can use this money to settle the medical expenses."

Xie Haitao spoke grandiosely, but his heart was bursting with joy.

Zhou Yongliang said, "These sick children are all students from Jiangnan City Central Primary School. This afternoon, a child picked up a bat, and 12 children who had contact with the bat developed high fever and comatose symptoms.

Upon seeing the middle-aged man, Zhou Yongliang enthusiastically greeted him.

"Mr. Dong is too humble, treating patients is my duty."

Thinking of this, his heart felt much more at ease.

At this point, Xie Haitao couldn't claim to be an imposter, so he had to grit his teeth and endure.

Xie Haitao agreed and walked over.

Ye Bufan scoffed, he originally intended to expose this guy, but now he wasn't in a hurry.

Ye Bufan said, "No, he's overcharging. We can't tolerate his bad habits. We won't give him a single cent."

Zhou Yongliang said in surprise, "Dr. Xie, you are also proficient in traditional Chinese medicine?"

Other hospitals found no effective treatment, but Dr. Xie successfully cured that case, and the effect was so good. Jiangnan Hospital has made a great achievement this time."

"Yes, yes, I'll ask them to leave now." Xie Haitao turned around and said, "The medical expenses can be discussed. I'll talk to you after I'm done."

Dong Tianda asked nervously, "Dr. Xie, are you sure this method works?"

There is no turning back once the arrow is shot. Xie Haitao gritted his teeth and said, "It definitely works. The case just now was cured this way."

Seeing that Dong Tianda said nothing more, he took out the third silver needle and pierced the Tiantu acupoint on the little boy's chest.
