<h1>Chapter 5 The Truth Revealed</h1>

<p>What he didn't realize was that after the third silver needle was inserted, the little boy immediately began to foam at the mouth, convulse, and his face turned as pale as a corpse.</p>
<p>At the same time, the monitoring equipment at the head of the bed emitted a piercing alarm sound. His blood pressure dropped, his heart rate quickly slowed down, and he was on the verge of death.</p>
<p>Looking at the scene in front of him, Xie Haitao was stunned. He no longer had the courage to insert the fourth silver needle he held in his hand.</p>
<p>Dong Tianda said angrily, "What on earth is going on? Can you treat people or not? How did you treat my son like this?"</p>
<p>Zhou Yongliang also said nervously, "Dr. Xie, what's going on? Did you have this kind of situation when you just cured that case?"</p>
<p>"Director, I... I..."</p>
<p>Xie Haitao was covered in cold sweat, too anxious to speak. He was also baffled and didn't know what was going on.</p>
<p>Ye Bufan was not surprised by this result, and the little boy's situation was urgent, so there was no time to delay.</p>
<p>I still owe the hospital more than 30,000 yuan in medical expenses. What do you two think I should do?"</p>
<p>Dong Tianda was a very shrewd businessman. He didn't do this on impulse.</p>
<p>Now, seeing Ye Bufan's calm expression, he was even more convinced of his inner thoughts.</p>
<p>As if feeling what Ye Bufan was about to say, Xie Haitao looked at him with a pleading face.</p>
<p>After entering the door, he glanced at Xie Haitao, who was slumped on the ground, then went to the little boy's bed, took out a silver needle, and began to treat him.</p>
<p>Seeing his son's condition getting more and more critical, Dong Tianda roared, "Stop bullshitting and cure my son quickly."</p>
<p>Ye Bufan put away the silver needle, glanced at Xie Haitao, who was next to him, and said, "Director Zhou, I really need your help with something."</p>
<p>When he withdrew the silver needle, all the data on the monitoring equipment at the head of the bed returned to normal. The little boy opened his eyes and sat up from the bed.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"I... I..."</p>
<p>"Xiao Ye, you've helped me a lot this time. Just tell me if you need any help."</p>
<p>When the ancient medical sect treated people, someone once offered a city as a consultation fee.</p>
<p>Xie Haitao helplessly pulled out all three silver needles, but the little boy's condition still didn't improve at all.</p>
<p>"Bastard, you did a good job!" Ma Haidong grabbed the payment receipt and slammed it on Xie Haitao's face. "You just faked it and claimed credit for Brother Ye, and now you've caused so much trouble.</p>
<p>Zhou Yongliang said, "Just tell me what's going on."</p>
<p>Zhou Yongliang and Ma Haidong both came from the medical system and immediately saw the trickiness in the billing details.</p>
<p>Seeing that the last sick child had also been treated, Zhou Yongliang breathed a sigh of relief. This matter had a great impact in the entire Jiangnan City, and the city's senior officials were paying attention.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaoman hesitated for a moment, but finally said, "It wasn't Doctor Xie who cured that child, but that patient's family member named Ye Bufan outside."</p><p>You don't deserve to be a doctor. From now on, you are fired."</p>
<p>Now that Jiangnan Hospital has successfully treated all the infected children, it has also earned him enough face.</p>
<p>Being able to befriend a miracle doctor is equivalent to having an extra life at a critical moment. After all, no matter how much money you have, you need to be alive to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Xie Haitao was drenched in cold sweat, mumbling for a long time, but couldn't even say a complete sentence.</p>
<p>He remembered clearly that Ye Bufan treated the little boy this way. Why did it not only not work in his hands, but also worsen the condition?</p>
<p>In his opinion, merely offering some money was not enough to befriend a master like Ye Bufan, so he made such a generous offer.</p>
<p>But Ye Bufan didn't even look at it. He took out the billing details and said, "Director Zhou, Director Ma, this is the billing details that Doctor Xie just gave my mother.</p>
<p>Ma Haidong felt that something was wrong and said to Zhang Xiaoman, who was next to him, "Tell me, what exactly happened?"</p>
<p>After learning the truth, Dong Tianda immediately rushed out of the emergency room. Now, no matter who it was, as long as they could save his son, it was fine.</p>
<p>Seeing that they earned a restaurant in one go, Zhou Yongliang and Ma Haidong both showed envy in their eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes, what are you still dawdling about? Hurry up and find a way to save him!"</p>
<p>This time, Xie Haitao was completely dumbfounded and pleaded, "Director, please, give me another chance. I won't dare to do it again."</p>
<p>Although Ye Bufan was just a poor boy before, he inherited the ancient medical art. He was not surprised by Dong Tianda's performance. After all, no matter how much money you have, it cannot be compared with human life.</p>
<p>At the same time, the little boy no longer convulsed and foamed at the mouth. His complexion slowly returned to ruddy, and his breathing stabilized.</p>
<p>And infusions, these IV bags add up to at least 25 kilograms. Even if it were injected into a cow, it probably wouldn't be able to handle it, right?</p>
<p>Dong Tianda jumped up in anger, "Xie, I only have one son. If anything happens to him, I'll kill you immediately."</p>
<p>This was the second time he treated such a case, and Ye Bufan was already familiar with it. He quickly pricked the little boy's fingertips and squeezed out two drops of toxic blood.</p>
<p>Dong Tianda repeatedly expressed his gratitude and left with his child. Then, other patients came to Jiangnan Hospital with their children one after another, and Ye Bufan treated them all.</p>
<p>He clearly had a severe cerebral hemorrhage, but the medication included antithrombotic drugs and heart medication. The only thing missing was aphrodisiacs.</p>
<p>Zhou Yongliang said angrily, "Xie Haitao, didn't you just cure a patient? Why can't you do it now?"</p>
<p>He rushed to Ye Bufan and said eagerly, "Young man, please save my son. You can name your conditions."</p>
<p>"Miracle doctor! He's truly a miracle doctor!" Dong Tianda held Ye Bufan's hand and said, "Little miracle doctor, our Dong family has been a single lineage for three generations. You saved my son, which means you saved our entire Dong family. Our Dong family has no shortage of restaurants. My older brother just built a large restaurant, and I'll give it to you as a consultation fee. I'll handle the transfer procedures for you when I get back."</p>
<p>He asked Ouyang Lan to go back and rest, then followed Dong Tianda into the emergency room.</p>
<p>My mother was admitted to the hospital last night and has spent thirty-nine thousand eight hundred yuan in less than twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Ma Haidong was also extremely anxious. If Xie Haitao really killed Dong Tianda's son, he, as the director, would probably be at the end of his career.</p>
<p>Originally, the monitoring equipment at the head of the bed kept emitting piercing alarms, but as the silver needles were inserted one by one, the equipment stopped alarming.</p>
<p>He left Ye Bufan's phone number, then took out a business card and said, "Little brother, just come to me if you need anything in the future."</p>
<p>Seeing that the matter had been completely exposed, Xie Haitao's legs went weak, and he collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Ye Bufan said, "Director Ma, this kind of private addition of drugs and arbitrary charging seems to have violated the law, right? I think it's more appropriate to hand it over to the police.</p><p>And he probably did more than just this once. He must have done it many times before, and all of them need to be investigated clearly."</p>
<p>Zhou Yongliang said, "What Brother Ye said is right. These people are蛀虫 (moths) in the medical field. Doctors' reputations are ruined by them. We must investigate thoroughly and then hand them over to the police."</p>
