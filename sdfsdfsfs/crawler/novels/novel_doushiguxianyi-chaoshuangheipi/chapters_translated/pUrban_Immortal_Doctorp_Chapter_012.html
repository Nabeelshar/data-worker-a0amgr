<h1>Chapter 12: Prepare for the Aftermath</h1>

Ye Bufan looked back and saw a young woman in her twenties standing at the door. She had delicate features, a tall figure, and a ponytail, giving her a heroic and spirited aura.

"What are you doing? Don't you know my grandpa is seriously ill and can't be touched casually?"

The woman walked in with a face full of anger. She was He Tianqi's daughter, He Changqing's granddaughter, He Shuangshuang.

He Shuangshuang had a very stubborn personality. She had studied abroad in the US for three years, but upon her return, she didn't follow the family's arrangements to join the business. Instead, she joined the Public Security Bureau as a police officer and is now the deputy captain of the criminal investigation team.

"Shuangshuang, why are you back?" He Tianqi stepped forward and said, "This is Dr. Ye Bufan, he's here to treat your grandpa."

"How old is he? And he's going to treat my grandpa? Has he even graduated from medical school?"

Seeing that Ye Bufan was even younger than herself, a hint of disdain flashed across He Shuangshuang's icy face, clearly not taking him seriously.

Upon hearing this, Ye Bufan's face immediately darkened.

He Shuangshuang completely ignored their expressions and turned to Gao Haisheng, saying, "Dr. Gao, I'll leave my grandpa's illness to you."

"Since someone is treating the old man, then we'll go back first."

Over the years, Old He had seen many Western medicine experts and professors, but none of them had any solutions. Later, we'll need to trouble little brother Ye to take action."

She had the closest relationship with her grandpa and naturally didn't want to see Elder He pass away.

Just a few days ago, Dr. Gao had received an invitation from the World Medical Association and would soon become a member there.

He Shuangshuang asked anxiously, "What? Dr. Gao, can't you think of another way?"

The old man's illness has dragged on for too long, coupled with his advanced age and declining bodily functions. Even a deity couldn't help him. It's time to prepare for the funeral."

Hearing the string of titles, He Tianqi quickly stepped forward and said, "Dr. Gao, thank you for your hard work."

He Tianqi said awkwardly, "Shuangshuang, mind your manners. Dr. Ye is a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine."

Thinking of this, he no longer left and stayed with Cao Xinghua.

He Shuangshuang had received a Western education since childhood and had studied abroad in the US, so she held TCM in complete disdain.

He Tianqi was very surprised by Cao Xinghua's attitude towards Ye Bufan, wondering what virtues this young man possessed to be held in such high regard by Elder Cao.

It's fine if you like to show off, we won't say anything, but you don't need to slander TCM.

As a result, he turned around and had no solutions at all, telling the family that they could only prepare for the funeral. What kind of doctor is that?

"Boy, what nonsense are you talking about?"

Since the He family didn't trust him, there was no need for him to stay here.

Looking at the test results in his hand, his brows furrowed deeper and deeper.

Cao Xinghua said, "Xiao Ye, if we leave, it means we agree that Traditional Chinese Medicine is inferior to Western medicine, and that will make those people even more smug.

Gao Haisheng nodded proudly, then said, "With me here, there's no need to find other doctors for the old man's illness, especially some unknown TCM practitioners. Can those roots and rotten tree bark really cure diseases?"

Ye Bufan said, "Elder Cao, it's not that I'm not giving you face. When I treat patients, I always believe in fate. I've never had the habit of begging to treat people."

At this moment, someone next to them said, "Are these your Western medicine experts? After studying in the US for so many years, is all you learned how to tell the patient's family to prepare for the funeral?"

"Don't worry, I will definitely provide the most advanced treatment for the old man."

He Shuangshuang continued, "Dr. Gao is a doctoral graduate from the US and a leading internal medicine expert in the capital. He has unique research in cardiology and pulmonology, and has published twenty to thirty papers in journals sponsored by the World Medical Association.

As long as my father can be cured, our He family is willing to bear any cost, no matter how great."

"Traditional Chinese Medicine? What a joke. Traditional Chinese Medicine is inherently unreliable, let alone a TCM practitioner this young."

He Tianqi and He Shuangshuang both looked disappointed; deep down, neither of them wanted this outcome.

After saying that, he turned to leave, but Cao Xinghua grabbed him. "Xiao Ye, don't rush off. In my opinion, these people definitely can't cure Old He.

He Tianqi then saw that there was also a middle-aged doctor in his forties standing at the door, followed by four or five assistants in white coats, carrying various medical devices in their hands.

She continued, "Dad, let me introduce you. This is my friend, Dr. Gao Haisheng, a cardiopulmonary expert invited from the capital."

Are you, Gao Haisheng, not impressive? Aren't you a great expert in Western medicine? Aren't you famous throughout China? Then today, I will slap your face and show you what true ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine is.

Gao Haisheng, with his assistants, completed one examination after another for He Changqing, and finally, reports piled up in his hands.

His words moved Ye Bufan. With TCM declining rapidly, as a descendant of the ancient medical sect, he indeed should do something for TCM.

This time, Dr. Gao canceled many commitments to come and treat my grandpa in his busy schedule."

Cao Xinghua's expression also became extremely unpleasant. As someone who had dedicated his entire life to Traditional Chinese Medicine, he naturally couldn't accept others looking down on it.

The one who spoke was naturally Ye Bufan. He was indeed dissatisfied with Gao Haisheng's approach. He had just boasted so much, looking down on everyone, with the air of a divine doctor.

Gao Haisheng sighed and shook his head, saying, "The illness is already deeply entrenched. Hurry and prepare for the funeral."

These words were very polite, but everyone could see that between Gao Haisheng and Ye Bufan, he chose the former.

Gao Haisheng shook his head and said, "I'm very sorry, I am an expert, but not all diseases can be cured.

Ye Bufan inherited the ancient medical sect's legacy, and while his principle was to save the world and help people, a healer has their dignity and never begs to treat people.

He Tianqi also followed up nervously, "Yes, Dr. Gao, you are an expert in cardiology and pulmonology, you must find a way.

The most important thing for us to do now is to cure Old He, and to use our medical skills to slap them in the face, allowing Traditional Chinese Medicine to rise in prominence."

After Gao Haisheng finished speaking, he had his assistants take out various medical instruments and began to perform all sorts of examinations on He Changqing.

He was also very dissatisfied with the He family's behavior, but with his old friend's life at stake, he couldn't afford to dwell on it.

He Tianqi looked at Cao Xinghua and Ye Bufan somewhat awkwardly, "Uncle Cao, I'm sorry, you know this girl's temper. She speaks without thinking. Please don't take it to heart.

He Shuangshuang asked nervously, "Dr. Gao, how is my grandpa's illness? Is there still hope?"

The two of you please rest first, and after they are done, then please diagnose my father."

As an internal medicine expert from the capital, Gao Haisheng was accustomed to flattery wherever he went. When had he ever been reprimanded like this?

He furiously said, "Doctors are not gods, not all diseases can be cured. The patient's condition is severe, not because I am incompetent, but because no one can cure it."

Ye Bufan sneered, "No one can cure it? Who gave you the courage to say such a thing? Do you represent all doctors in the world?"
